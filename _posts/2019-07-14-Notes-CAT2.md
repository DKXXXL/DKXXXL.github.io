# Notes on Category Theory, __2__.


## Constructions **on** Category
The constructions **on** categories include product category (objects are tuples where each element is an object of the original categories and arrows are tuples of original arrows, composition is just element-wise position-respective composition), slice category, arrow category and opposite (dual) category. These concept are all not hard to grasp and used in many places.

Product category is trivial but useful because it makes the concept of a functor automatically applicable when arity is higher or equal to 2.

Slice category and arrow category are great exercises. The arrows and objects all stand for the arrows in the original category. And once you touch the concept of natural transformation, you will realize the similarity between it and arrow category.

The most important of them all is opposite category. One example I have to mention is **Set**$^{op}$ (the dual of the category **Set**). The objects are the same, while now an arrow $f^{op}: A \rightarrow B$ actually represents the arrow $f :B \rightarrow A$ in the **Set**. In other words, an arrow $A \rightarrow B$ in **Set**$^{op}$ is actually a function from the set $B$ to the set $A$. 

This is said to be "totally formally construction" by Awodey while I don't quite agree. Because I think "totally formally" stands for "no meaning", or a situation where I write down "A" and say this A stands for nothing but only this alphabet, this literal itself. However, here, this dual category actually stands for something. It is more like an alias, or a renaming, on the original category. We just change the direction of the arrows.

Another example is that I am not comfortable with the idea of contravariant functor and always use opposite category and functor to represent that.
