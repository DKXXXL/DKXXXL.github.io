# Notes on Category Theory, __2__.


## Constructions **on** Categories
The constructions **on** categories include product category (objects are tuples where each element is an object of the original categories and arrows are tuples of original arrows, composition is just element-wise position-respective composition), slice category, arrow category and opposite (dual) category. These concept are all not hard to grasp and used in many places.

Product category is trivial but useful because it makes the concept of a functor automatically applicable when arity is higher or equal to 2.

Slice category and arrow category are great exercises. The arrows and objects all stand for the arrows in the original category. And once you touch the concept of natural transformation, you will realize the similarity between it and arrow category.

The most important of them all is opposite category. One example I have to mention is **Set**$^{op}$ (the dual of the category **Set**). The objects are the same, while now an arrow $f^{op}: A \rightarrow B$ actually represents the arrow $f :B \rightarrow A$ in the **Set**. In other words, an arrow $A \rightarrow B$ in **Set**$^{op}$ is actually a function from the set $B$ to the set $A$. 

This is said to be "totally formally construction" by Awodey while I don't quite agree. Because I think "totally formally" stands for "no meaning", i.e. a situation where I write down "A" and say this A stands for nothing but only this alphabet, this literal itself. However, here, this dual category actually stands for something. It is more like an alias, or a renaming, on the original category. We just change the direction of the arrows in representation.

### **Some Controversy Below, Might not be correct**

Another example is that, just as [nlab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/contravariant+functor) says, a contravariant functor **is** a functor from the opposite category. The 'is' here, actually stands for 'is equivalent to', not exactly meaning 'the same object'. (*The way phrased in the nlab using 'is' confuses me a great deal.*)

Recall, in category $\mathcal{ A}$, 
> $Hom_{\mathcal{A}}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a bifunctor mapping from $\mathcal{A}$ to **Set**.



To be more concentrated on the idea of contravariant functor, take arbitrary object $A$, partially applied,
$Hom_{\mathcal{A}}(\cdot, A)$ is a contravariant functor mapping to  **Set**. 

An interesting fact is that, you will see in some places take as notation $Hom_{\mathcal{A}}(\cdot, A): \mathcal{A}^{op} \rightarrow$ **Set** or $Hom_{\mathcal{A}}(\cdot, \cdot) : \mathcal{A}^{op} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow$**Set**. It of course doesn't make sense because $\mathcal{A}^{op}$ is ultimately a different category as $\mathcal{A}$, of which objects of course cannot put into $Hom_{\mathcal{A}}$. What's more, **HOW CAN AN ARROW CROSS CATEGORY?** Let alone saying the set of arrows of two objects of different categories.  This notation may just stands for a short hand, suggesting a contravariance in the first position of the arguments. 

(*see, the product category is helpful in expressing the domain of the functors*).
