This note is mainly trying to solve the following questions
0. What is the motivation of CBPV?
1. Why there is a computation class of types?
2. What is this adjunction between $F$ and $U$ mean?
3. Why all positive types located in value but negative types located in computation?
4. How to add new effect?
5. How to add new type construct? Do I just add positive type into value and negative type 

Among them, 4 and 5 are most important. I don't think this note can really solve

## Motivation
I think the motivation is mainly for $\eta$-rules
