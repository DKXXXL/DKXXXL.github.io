We are technical reviewing

1. soundness + completeness of categorical semantic
2. Theory-as-category
3. classifying category, universal model
4. Theory-model Correspondence
5. Free model?
6. logic duality

This is a further review of 1.

# Theory-as-category (Theory as *Classifying Category*)

Theory `ùïã` itself is **not** category, (it is just a bunch of string), but we can find a classifying category `CL(ùïã)` satisying
`Mod(ùïã, C) ‚âÖ Hom(CL(ùïã), C)`,
LHS means model of `ùïã` in category `C`, RHS are at least functors.

That means each model corresponds to a functor.

TLDR: it means the categorification of a given theory.

#### For example, 
For algebraic theory , 


#### Compared to Free CCC

Free CCC is generated upon the *signature* of operations (in Lambek 1988 it is the graph),
but classifying category is generated upon the theory itself (instead of the signature)


However, in (Levy 05), do we just 'confuse' the theory with the signature? NO!

## Universal Model

# Theory-Model Equivalence


# Free Model?

Free model seems to based on signature but classifying category is not based on the signature?

Questions
1. Is "free algebra" just "free model"? (I mean they have the same definition, or one is just an alias of the other)?
2.
