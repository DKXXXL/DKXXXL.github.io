# Theory-as-category

## Concretely, and classically

For *each signature Σ*, we can construct *the theory 𝕋Σ*, where we can **do syntactic induction** (structual induction).

This is corresponding to

For each *set of base type and operations ξ*, we can construct a free algebra *F(ξ)*, **satisfying the adjunction.**

Basically the *F(ξ)* is exactly the categorical representation of  *the theory 𝕋Σ*.

The adjunction is also exactly the elimination principle.

So the best way to understand a free algebra *F(ξ)*, is to consider it as AST.

## Mathmatically, 

In the example of STLC/CCC,

For *each signature Σ* (In Lambek 1988, this is represented as a graph `: Gr`), to a cartesian closed category (a concrete algebra), 

then we have two functors adjoint `F -| U : CCC → Gr`, where `U` maps a cartesian closed category to its underlying graph,

this adjoint `Hom(F(Σ), Y) ≅ Hom(Σ, U(Y))` explains the elimination principle from *the theory 𝕋Σ* -- basically given an algebra `Y`, when we set up a certain interpretation for the base (signature `Σ`) that is an arrow `Σ → U(Y)`, we will have a cartsian closed functor (an algebra morphism) between the free `F(Σ)` and the original algebra `Y`, acts like an elimination principle.
