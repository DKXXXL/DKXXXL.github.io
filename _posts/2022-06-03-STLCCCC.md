### Last Time : [Use QIIT Framework for meta-theory reasoning on Type Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360085224_A_Review_of_Algebraic-Style_Reasoning_for_Type_Theory)

***
Currently, our exploration will focus on why categorical semantic is favoured over using QIIT framework when doing type theory

This time, 
# Free CCC is syntax, Why?

1. How is it defined?
<!-- Citation -->
Following [Lambek 1988](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=6PY_emBeGjUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=introduction+to+higher+order+categorical+logic&ots=AxkZI4rUn8&sig=Hi79tmJjQH6w9LX4MRZZKbhrFeg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=introduction%20to%20higher%20order%20categorical%20logic&f=false)
<!-- What is Free? -->

<!-- Universal Property can help here? Corresponding to QIIT? -->
<!-- Formalized in Agda -->
