### Last Time : [Use QIIT Framework for meta-theory reasoning on Type Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360085224_A_Review_of_Algebraic-Style_Reasoning_for_Type_Theory)

***
Our exploration will focus on why categorical semantic is favoured over using QIIT framework when doing type theory

This time, 
# Free CCC is syntax, Why?

If a given object is syntax, we need to have a strong enough mapping out arrow acting like elimination principle, so that we can do induction on it to reason (Just like dealing with QIIT)!

1. How is it defined?
<!-- Citation -->
* Following [Lambek 1988](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=6PY_emBeGjUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=introduction+to+higher+order+categorical+logic&ots=AxkZI4rUn8&sig=Hi79tmJjQH6w9LX4MRZZKbhrFeg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=introduction%20to%20higher%20order%20categorical%20logic&f=false), we can see there is an adjoint functor between free CCC and graph, and the universal property is defined in the book
* So if we generate Free CCC using empty graph (an initial object in **Graph** category), then we will also have an initial object in the category of CCC, due to this adjunction. This initiality should be acting like elimination principle.
* Thus once we prove a model is a CCC, due to this initiality, we should have a unique arrow from this free CCC to the given model, acting like elimination

<!-- 2. How is the actual "Free-ness" defined, and how is this used (in other context)? -->
## Connection between Free-ness/Initiality and Elimination Principle.

* Definition of Free (Write out the definition of free (as adjoint of forgetful functor))
  * As we know The Initial Object is exactly Elimination principle, 
    * and we have initiality in these algebra using free-ness to generate upon the initial object
* is the existence of inductive type exactly free-ness?
  * if we only consider W-type, where does free-ness come from for W-type? 
* [Syntactical Model is usually free?](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lindenbaum-Tarski+algebra)
  * Is free model always "equivalent to" syntactical model?
    * we have three notion here, free, initial and syntactical
      * free-ness is defined by the adjoint functor
      * initiality means 
      * but how did syntactical model defined? Defined by generator? Or Defined by quotient of something?
        * I think it is okay to define as free-model(result of generation)
* Show the universal property of free-ness/initiality is indicating each case of the pattern matching and recursor
## Lindenbaum-Tarski+algebra
1. Write out the definition Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra 
2. Prove  Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra  is "free algebra" (present an adjoint functor)
3. Specify the initiality conjecture (and [the proof here](https:--arxiv.org/abs/2006.16949))
4. Indicate the same game of term model, initial model, free algebra of dependent type theory and Generalized Algebraic Theory
   * Free cartesian closed category
   * Free algebra of Lawvere Theory
   * Generalized Algebraic Theory

<!-- What is Free? -->

<!-- A concrete example? -->
# Free CCC, continued

<!-- Formalized in Agda-like internal language, use CCC artin-gluing model and its internal language
      to prove canonicity -->

3. However, Free CCC doesn't seem so helpful as a tool because it is not easy to see how to extend this definition to support more type constructor. For example [I found it hard to extend to STLC + boolean type](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/51539/question-in-relating-stlc-and-free-ccc). 

4. [Thus we use the concept of Free SCWF (simply-typed CWF)](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/51541/question-about-free-ness-of-free-scwf). Roughly it can be considered as the data of a QIIT with STLC signature, just like how CWF corresponds to QIIT using MLTT signature.
* But here we don't really have "free-ness" mentioned [in the textbook](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00827.pdf), but we do have initiality, which is enough for us to see the existence of elimination principle

<!-- Consider if artin-gluing can be display on SCWF -->
