### Last Time : [Use QIIT Framework for meta-theory reasoning on Type Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360085224_A_Review_of_Algebraic-Style_Reasoning_for_Type_Theory)

***
Our exploration will focus on why categorical semantic is favoured over using QIIT framework when doing type theory

This time, 
# Free CCC is syntax, Why?

If a given object is syntax, we need to have a strong enough mapping out arrow acting like elimination principle, so that we can do induction on it to reason (Just like dealing with QIIT)!

1. How is it defined?
<!-- Citation -->
* Following [Lambek 1988](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=6PY_emBeGjUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=introduction+to+higher+order+categorical+logic&ots=AxkZI4rUn8&sig=Hi79tmJjQH6w9LX4MRZZKbhrFeg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=introduction%20to%20higher%20order%20categorical%20logic&f=false), we can see there is an adjoint functor between free CCC and graph, and the universal property is defined in the book
* So if we generate Free CCC using empty graph (an initial object in **Graph** category), then we will also have an initial object in the category of CCC, due to this adjunction. This initiality should be acting like elimination principle.
* Thus once we prove a model is a CCC, due to this initiality, we should have a unique arrow from this free CCC to the given model, acting like elimination

2. However, Free CCC is tooo weak to be helpful. [Basically we cannot impose customized intro-elimination rules at all](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/51539/question-in-relating-stlc-and-free-ccc).
   1. We either need to use ["Sketch on CCC"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10783)
   2. or we can resort to other similar notion, like [free scwf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00827).

## Free SCWF
1. Roughly it can be considered as the data of a QIIT with STLC signature, just like how CWF corresponds to QIIT using MLTT signature.
2. In the original text, free scwf doesn't mention its free-ness, but we do have initiality, which is enough for us to see the existence of elimination principle
3. However, free SCWF can be [really free](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/51541/question-about-free-ness-of-free-scwf)

<!-- 2. How is the actual "Free-ness" defined, and how is this used (in other context)? -->
## Connection between Free-ness, Initiality and Elimination Principle.
* Definition of Free 
  * Adjunction between two functors $F : C \to D$ and $G : D \to C$ has three formulations. 
    * Two of them are [Hom-Iso](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor#InTermsOfHomIsomorphism) 
    * and [(co)unit](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor#UniversalArrows) 
  * Free functor is left adjoint to forgetful functors. 
    * Usually forgetful functors are just functors forgetting some structures, and thus there is no official definition of forgetful functors
  * As we know The Initial Object is exactly Elimination principle, 
    * and we have initiality in these algebra using free-ness to generate upon the initial object
* is the existence of inductive type exactly some sort of free-ness?
  * if we only consider [W-type](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/W-type#wtypes_in_categories), where does free-ness come from for W-type? 
* [Syntactical Model is usually free?](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lindenbaum-Tarski+algebra)
  * Is free model always "equivalent to" syntactical model?
    * we have three notion here, free, initial and syntactical
      * free-ness is defined by the adjoint functor
      * initiality means 
      * but how did syntactical model defined? Defined by generator? Or Defined by quotient of something?
        * I think it is okay to define as free-model(result of generation)
<!-- A concrete example? -->
## Lindenbaum-Tarski+algebra
1. Write out the definition Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra 
2. Prove Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra  is "free algebra" (present an adjoint functor)
3. Specify the initiality conjecture (and [the proof here](https:--arxiv.org/abs/2006.16949))
4. Indicate the same game of term model, initial model, free algebra of dependent type theory and Generalized Algebraic Theory
   * Free cartesian closed category
   * Free algebra of Lawvere Theory
   * Generalized Algebraic Theory



# Free CCC, continued

<!-- Formalized in Agda-like *internal language*, use CCC artin-gluing model and its internal language
      to prove canonicity 
  Just like what sterling did in his thesis   
  -->

<!-- Consider if artin-gluing can be replayed on SCWF? -->
