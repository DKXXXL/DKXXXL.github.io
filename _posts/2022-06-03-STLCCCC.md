### Last Time : [Use QIIT Framework for meta-theory reasoning on Type Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360085224_A_Review_of_Algebraic-Style_Reasoning_for_Type_Theory)

***
Our exploration will focus on why categorical semantic is favoured over using QIIT framework when doing type theory


This time, 
# Free CCC is syntax, Why?


<!-- 2. How is the actual "Free-ness" defined, and how is this used (in other context)? -->
## Connection between Free-ness, Initiality and Elimination Principle.
* Definition of Free 
  * Adjunction between two functors $F : C \to D$ and $G : D \to C$ has three formulations. 
    * Two of them are [Hom-Iso](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor#InTermsOfHomIsomorphism) 
    * and [(co)unit factorization](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor#UniversalArrows) 
    * These two combined can give you clearest understanding of the definition.
  * Free functor is left adjoint to forgetful functors. 
    * Usually forgetful functors are just functors forgetting some structures, and thus there is no official definition of forgetful functors
  * As we know The Initial Object is exactly Elimination principle, 
    * and we have initiality in these algebra using free-ness to generate upon the initial object
* is the existence of inductive type exactly some sort of free-ness? 
  * if we only consider [W-type](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/W-type#wtypes_in_categories), where does free-ness come from for W-type? <!-- this part might be too hard, we need to connect the extensional property with the intensional one, and the intensional one is some sort of transfinite construction bla bla horrible  -->
* [Syntactical Model is usually free?](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lindenbaum-Tarski+algebra)
  * Is free model always "equivalent to" syntactical model?
    * we have three notion here, free, initial and syntactical
      * free-ness is defined by the adjoint functor
      * initiality, which is basically implied by free-ness
      * but how did syntactical model defined? Defined by generator? Or Defined by quotient of something?
        * I think it is okay to define as free-model(result of generation)
    * I think since free-ness subsume initiality to some extent, we only talk about the difference between term model and free models
      * what's more, by Proposition 1.10 [here](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor#UniversalArrows) we know certain collection of initiality implies is equivalent to free-ness
    * term model is one concrete intensional/syntactic construction of free model, and free model is described by adjoint functor thus extensional

## Free CCC

If a given object is syntax, we need to have a strong enough mapping out arrow acting like elimination principle, so that we can do induction on it to reason (Just like dealing with QIIT)! Why Free CCC have elimination principle.

1. How is it defined?

* Following [Lambek 1988](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=6PY_emBeGjUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=introduction+to+higher+order+categorical+logic&ots=AxkZI4rUn8&sig=Hi79tmJjQH6w9LX4MRZZKbhrFeg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=introduction%20to%20higher%20order%20categorical%20logic&f=false), we can see there is an adjoint functor between free CCC and graph $\mathcal{F} \dashv \mathcal{U}$: **CCC** $\to$ **Graph** and the universal property is defined in the book
  * basically the universal property is saying any arrow $F: X \to U(Y)$ is (co)unit factorized by $X \to U(F(X)) \to U(Y)$.
* So if we generate Free CCC using empty graph (an initial object in **Graph** category), then we will also have an initial object in the category of CCC, due to this adjunction. This initiality should be acting like elimination principle.
* Thus once we prove a model is a CCC, due to this initiality, we should have a unique arrow from this free CCC to the given model, acting like elimination

Another notion is Free SCWF.
## Free SCWF
1. Roughly it can be considered as the data of a QIIT with STLC signature, just like how CWF corresponds to QIIT using MLTT signature.
2. In the original text, free scwf doesn't mention its free-ness, but we do have initiality, which is enough for us to see the existence of elimination principle
3. However, free SCWF can be [really free](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/51541/question-about-free-ness-of-free-scwf), 
4. the idea is formally formulated at Proposition 1.10 [here](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor#UniversalArrows).
   1. Why initial object of the comma category leads to the factorization? 
   2. Why the above factorization means initial object of the comma category?
      1. These two hold trivially because that comma category is full of objects of the form $(c, f, R(?))$ 
   3. Then Prop 1.10 holds trivially
5. Let's go back, basically we want to show there should be an adjoint between $F \dashv U :$ **Set** $\to$ **SCwf**, here we know $F$ will map base type set $B$ to the initial object in $B$-SCwf. To show adjunction, we need to show $(B, ?, U(F(B)))$ is the initial object of the category of $(B, ?, U(?))$. 
   1. Consider the definition of $B$-SCwf -- basically SCwf with interpretation $\llbracket ?\rrbracket_B : B \to Ty$, thus each object $(C, Ty, Tm, \llbracket ?\rrbracket_B)$ in $B$-SCwf is an objet in $(B, ?, U(?))$, in the form of $(B, \llbracket ?\rrbracket_B, U((C, Ty, ...)))$
   2. So now it is clear that, $F$ is the construction mentioned in Prop 4 of [free scwf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00827)
   3. and $F \dashv U$ where $U$ simply returns the $Ty$ in scwf
6. But syntactically, this SCWF is even weaker than CCC


<!-- more concrete examples? -->

## Lindenbaum-Tarski+algebra, 
0. I should run some examples here but I am too lazy
1. Write out the definition Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra 
2. Prove Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra  is "free algebra" (present an adjoint functor)
3. Specify the initiality conjecture (and [the proof here](https:--arxiv.org/abs/2006.16949))
4. Indicate the same game of term model, initial model, free algebra for dependent type theory and Generalized Algebraic Theory
5. We have following related example about free/forgetful pair
   * **Graph** $\dashv$ cartesian closed category
   * ? $\dashv$ Free algebra of Lawvere Theory
   <!-- * Generalized Algebraic Theory -->

However, Free CCC/SCwf is tooo weak to be helpful. [Basically we cannot impose customized intro-elimination rules at all](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/51539/question-in-relating-stlc-and-free-ccc).
We need to use ["Sketch on CCC"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10783) or back to QIIT about it. But QIIT doesn't seem to have so many rich structures?

However, that paper is totally out of reach. The 2-monad and sketch is brand new for us...


<!-- ## What is a sketch? -->

# Free CCC, continued -->


<!-- Formalized in Agda-like *internal language*, use CCC artin-gluing model and its internal language
      to prove canonicity 
  Just like what sterling did in his thesis   

  But the key point is to use internal language seriously/rigorously

  Let's try to exhibit product object in the glued category, 
    in (Set ↓ Γ(⋅))
      where Γ(X) = Hom(1, X) global section functor
      The objects in (Set ↓ Γ(⋅)) is exactly (A', f, Γ(A)) for arbitrary A : Set and f : A -> Γ(A)
      can roughly be thought as subset of Hom(1, A).
  
  Let's recall CCC structure
    a category with finite products which is closed with respect to its cartesian monoidal structure, i.e. 
    given A, B, we have product object A × B
    given A, B, we have exponential object A ⇒ B

<!-- Consider if artin-gluing can be replayed on CWF? Or it is only on LCCC? -->
