# Ref1, Prop 3.2
3 => 1 is trivial, because inverse of the functor `A/a → 𝒮/p(a)` has already chosen the 

2 => 3:

Given 2 is the pullback. Now we need to constuct the inverse of the induced functor `A/a → 𝒮/p(a)`.
We know `A→ ≅ {(x ∈ A,y ∈ 𝒮→) : px = cod y}` because of the pullback, 
and actually this isomorphism is above the pullback.

so we have `F : A→ → {(x ∈ A,y ∈ 𝒮→) : px = cod y}` as an isomorphic functor such that

# What is the concrete construction of the nat model (in Uemura style)?
What are those discrete fib look like? And base category look like? For the walking type theory?
What does its category of representable map look like?
