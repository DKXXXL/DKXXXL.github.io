We type-set JS's STC and its application on proving a binary logic relation of STLC

***

(JS4, Example 1.2) has pointed out how to achieve  *Binary logical relations on closed term*. 

1. But what is binary logical relation on open term? 
2. (JS4, Chapter 4) uses ðŸ”’â‚›/â‚— and ðŸ”’â‚›/áµ£ , we need to figure out those
