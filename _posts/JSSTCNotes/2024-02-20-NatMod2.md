In this post, we need to connect definitions, especially connect to higher order model

***

In this post, we explore how "Higher Order Model (in Psh(𝒞))" corresponds to first order derivation rules in CwF.
The former one and the later one are both closely related to Nat Model, gives us a space to do investigation


# Universe in Category

Basically universe in a category (e.g. presheaf topos)
and 
universe in the internal language (DT) of a category (e.g. presheaf topos)

are the same thing, illustrated in (Ref 4, Pg 3, last paragraph)

We first simplify things

# Walking type theory

## Higher Order Model (in Psh(𝒞))

```
Ty : 𝒰
Tm : Ty → 𝒰
// Tm locally representable
```

## CwF
`(𝒞, Ty : Psh(𝒞), Tm : Psh(∫ Ty), (_._) ...)` (Ref 3, Def 3.4.1)
## Nat model
`(𝒞, Ty : Psh(𝒞), τ : Tm' → Ty)` (Ref 3, Lemma 3.4.7)

***
I mean connecting CwF with Nat Model is trivial (Ref 3, Right after Def 3.4.4)

To connect Nat model to higher order model :
Since we have `τ : Tm' → Ty` as a natural transformation in nat model, 
when using internal language of presheaf topos, `τ` is a dependent type `Ty ⊢ τ`, 

then by the universe of that presheaf topos, if we know we have a code `𝜏 : Ty → 𝒰`, `τ` is its 

So higher order model can only describe less things than CwF (because the number of code is not more than the type(arbitrary morphis), but in presheaf topos, I think code and types are corresponding).

So higher order model and Nat Model are not precisely corresponding to each other

## First Type/Term Code : Bool and true
## Higher Order Model (in Psh(𝒞))

```
Ty : 𝒰
Tm : Ty → 𝒰
// Tm locally representable
Bool : Ty 
true : El (Tm Bool)
```


## Nat Model
`Bool` is actually a nat transformation `1 → Ty`
`true` is actually a nat transformation `1 → El (Tm Bool)`

## CwF Model

why these two corresponds to
