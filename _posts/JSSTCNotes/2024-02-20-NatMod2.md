In this post, we need to connect definitions, especially connect to higher order model

***

In this post, we explore how "Higher Order Model (in Psh(𝒞))" corresponds to first order derivation rules in CwF.
The former one and the later one are both closely related to Nat Model, gives us a space to do investigation


# Universe in Category

Basically universe in a category (e.g. presheaf topos)
and 
universe in the internal language (DT) of a category (e.g. presheaf topos)

are the same thing, illustrated in (Ref 4, Pg 3, last paragraph)

***

We first simplify things : in this post, all the HOAS are restricted into
`X ⇒ Y` syntax, like Cw representable map.

And when we do interpretation, `X ⇒ Y` is interpreted as an arrow between object `X` and `Y`

This is a simplification of the interpretation of the internal language, later we use a real interpretation
of dt langauge (i.e. `X → Y`, where `X, Y` both are "types", and might be interpreted as a display map in category
  instead of an object like currently)

# Walking type theory

## Higher Order Model (in Psh(𝒞))

```
Ty : 𝒰
Tm : Ty → 𝒰
// Tm locally representable
```

## CwF
`(𝒞, Ty : Psh(𝒞), Tm : Psh(∫ Ty), (_._) ...)` (Ref 3, Def 3.4.1)
## Nat model
`(𝒞, Ty : Psh(𝒞), τ : Tm' → Ty)` (Ref 3, Lemma 3.4.7)

***
I mean connecting CwF with Nat Model is trivial (Ref 3, Right after Def 3.4.4)

To connect Nat model to higher order model :
Since we have `τ : Tm' → Ty` as a natural transformation in nat model, 
when using internal language of presheaf topos, `τ` is a dependent type `Ty ⊢ τ`, 

then by the universe of that presheaf topos, if we know we have a code `𝜏 : Ty → 𝒰`, `τ` is its 

So higher order model can only describe less things than CwF (because the number of code is not more than the type(arbitrary morphis), but in presheaf topos, I think code and types are corresponding).

So higher order model and Nat Model are not precisely corresponding to each other

***
So we need to further require that, `Tm : Ty → 𝒰` pullback along `El : 𝒰 → 𝒰` gives us the `τ : Tm' → Ty` in the nat model

I conjecture this is about 

# First Type/Term Code : Bool and true
## Higher Order Model (in Psh(𝒞))

```
Ty : 𝒰
Tm : Ty → 𝒰
// Tm locally representable
Bool : Ty 
true : El (Tm Bool)
```


## Nat Model
`Bool` is actually a nat transformation `1 → Ty`
`true` is actually a nat transformation `1 → El (Tm Bool)`

In nat model, we denote `El : ̃𝒰 → 𝒰`, and correspondingly the pullback of `El` along `Tm`, 
also the `τ : Tm' → Ty`. So we will use `El^Tm` to denote this pullback `Tm'`

## CwF Model

why these two corresponds to first order derivation?
`Bool : (1 = y1 → Ty) ≅ Ty(1)` so yes we have a derivation of a type in first order.

Basically we will get two pullback

```
   true                     ?X
1 ------> El^(Tm ∘ Bool) --------> El^Tm ---------> ̃𝒰
            |                       |               |   
            ↓ 1                     ↓τ              ↓El
            1 -------------------> Ty ------------> 𝒰
                     Bool                   Tm
```
What is `?X` ? I guess it is the sigma that will make `Tm ∘ Bool` into `∑ T, Tm T`.

Basically, we can see that `τ ∘ (?X ∘ true) = Bool`

# More generally
Can we prove that:

If given nat transformations `f : yΓ → El^Tm ` s.t. `τ ∘ f = T : yΓ → Ty`, 
then we can conclude there is a derivation rule of `Γ ⊢ f : T`.
(Basically Pg. 4 in Ref 2)

<!-- TODO -->

# Second Type/Term : ∏
∏ has binding, special compared to Bool and true.

In (Ref 2), it looks like
`∏ : (∑ (A : Ty), (A → Ty)) ⇒ Ty`,
