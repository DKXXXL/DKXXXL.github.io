# General Proof Structure

This is a summary of proof structure in (JS2, Chapter 5)

1. Still we use the same syntax.

2. Then we glue a topos based on renaming/atomic category 𝐴, and then do a glue (5.5.1∗7) via the figure shape α : 𝐴 → 𝑇.


3. Then we explore the existence of `var(A)` (JS2,5.5.3∗3) **The hardest! Have no idea**

4. Then we define normal, neutral form in the closed subspace of the glued topos (Section 5.4.1)

5. Finally we construct Synthetic Logical Relation 


## 5.5.3∗3



## The structure of Adequacy 

We need to spit out the adequacy result. This part is commeting (JS2, Sec 5.6).


First, recall https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Artin+gluing#some_details_and_further_adjunctions 
provides specifics for open/close immersion

### (5.6.1∗1) 
using `i_!` as part of the definition of atomic substitution simply because (5.6.1∗3) 

### (5.6.1∗4) 

claims, following 5.6.1∗4 itself

α! : Set𝐴 → Set𝑇 ⊣ α* : Set𝑇 

j*(i!(yA(Γ))) = j*(α!(yA(Γ)), ...) = α!(yA(Γ)) ≅ yT(α(Γ)) (α! is yoneda extension of α)

```
Hom (yA(Δ), α*j*(| Γ |))
≅ Hom (α_! yA(Δ), j*(| Γ |) )
≅ Hom (yT(α(Δ)), yT(α(Γ)))
≅ Hom(α(Δ), α(Γ))
```

### (5.6.2∗4) 

**We have computability structure of a canonical point**

Canonical points are form of `⟦Γ⟧ → X`.


So a `Hom_Set𝐺(⟦-⟧, X) : Set𝐴` turn into a computability structure by : 
1. by (5.6.2∗4) we have an arrow `f : Hom_Set𝐺(⟦-⟧, X) → α*j*X` in `Set𝐴`
2. an object in `Set𝐺` is a triple `(_₁ : Set𝑇, _₂ : Set𝐴, _₂ → α*(_₁) : Set𝐴)`.

3. So the turned computability is 
`(j*X, Hom_Set𝐺(⟦-⟧, X), f) `


So given `X`, we have `X_can := (j*X, Hom_Set𝐺(⟦-⟧, X), f) `

**We have computability structure of a atomic point**

Atomic points are form of `(| Γ |) → X`.


By (5.6.1∗3), `iso : i*X ≅ Hom_Set𝐺((| - |), X)`

So given `X`, we have `X = (j*X, i*X, X_f) ≅ (j*X, Hom_Set𝐺((| - |), X), iso ∘ X_f)`

A bit confusion comes from, is `X_f` one to one correspondes ` Hom_Set𝐺((| - |), X) → α*j*X`?

I guess so because every `X_f` uniquely corresponds to `X`, which uniquely corresponds to `X → j_*j*X`,
but we need a proof

Conjecture : every `X_f` is uniquely corresponding to the ` Hom_Set𝐺((| - |), X) → α*j*X` in 5.6.2∗4

## 5.6.2∗3

Why it can be pattern matching like that?

## 5.6.2∗6


`M(T) → M#(T)_can` is `α*yT(T) → Hom_Set𝐺(⟦-⟧,M#T)` simply because

```
M(T) = j_* (yT(T)) = (yT(T), α*yT(T), id)
```
So this commutative diagram is enough to specify this function

## Questions about adequacy
1. Why this adequacy is so complicated compared to STC-Canonicity proof? 

*** 
Then we can rearrange the above proof into our current STLC-NbE proof.

# Syntax

Syntax in STC is written in HOAS, as before

```agda 
record STLC : Set where 
  ty : □
  tm : ty → □
  bool : ty 
  true :  tm bool
  false : tm bool
  arr : ty → ty → ty
  lam : (tm A → tm B) → tm (arr A B)
  app : tm (arr A B) → tm A → tm B
  lamβ : app (lam f) = f
  lamη : lam (app f) = f 
```

Like STC for Canonicity, we write
