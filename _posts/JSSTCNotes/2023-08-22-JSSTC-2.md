We continue the learning of JS [thesis](https://www.jonmsterling.com/papers/sterling-2021-thesis.pdf).

Now we head to Chapter 2. To understand the language of Topoi, we need to cover the knowledge of 

**Type-Theoretic/Internal Language of Topos** along the way.

(2.0*3.1) Quote : 
For arbitrary `f : F → E`, the pullback functor `f* : ℰ / E → ℰ / F` is cocontinuous.
(2.0*4.1) Says it means “the notion of a colimit is type theoretic in the sense that it commutes
with substitution (pullback)”.

What is the above, rigorously speaking?

Let's make an example, we know coproduct is a colimit, so 


## (5.5.3∗3) 
This is a very hard section. 

1. A representable natural transformation, defined by https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3219 is 

2. α : 𝐴 → 𝑇, so α* : Pr(𝑇) → Pr(A), a logos functor

3. What is a "representable point" of α*tm : Pr(A) ?

4. 
> . By adjointness, each representable point of `α* tm : Pr(A)` is determined by an “atomic point”
of `tm : Pr(T)` , i.e. a morphism `α(Γ) → tm` for some atomic context

This sentence is mysterious, but I think it relates to (5.6.1∗4), where we can see 
`HomA(yA(Γ),  α*(tm)) ≅ HomT(yT(α(Γ)), tm)`

4. Why V can be **defined** using this pullback ?

5. What does V actually mean?
