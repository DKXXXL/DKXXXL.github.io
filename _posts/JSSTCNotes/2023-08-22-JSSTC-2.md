We continue the learning of JS [thesis](https://www.jonmsterling.com/papers/sterling-2021-thesis.pdf).

Now we head to Chapter 2. To understand the language of Topoi, we need to cover the knowledge of 

**Type-Theoretic/Internal Language of Topos** along the way.

(2.0*3.1) Quote : 
For arbitrary `f : F → E`, the pullback functor `f* : ℰ / E → ℰ / F` is cocontinuous.
(2.0*4.1) Says it means “the notion of a colimit is type theoretic in the sense that it commutes

What is the above, rigorously speaking?

Let's make an example, we know coproduct is a colimit, so
