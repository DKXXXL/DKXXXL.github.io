* Recall : Why Representable Nat Transformation corresponds to Category with Family?

Recall definition of CwF, using (Ref 3, Def 3.4.1) : 
a CwF is the following data 
1. A category `𝒞`
2. A presheaf `Ty` over `𝒞`
3. A presheaf `Tm` over `∫ Ty`, i.e. a depenednet presheaf over `Ty`
4. A chosen terminal object `1 ∈ 𝒞`
5. For each `c ∈ 𝒞` and `A ∈ Ty(c)`, there exists a chosen object `d ∈ 𝒞` equipped with 
   1. a map `p : d → c` and `q ∈ Tm (d, A ⋅ p : Ty(d))` 
   2. together with a bijection between `Hom(?, d)` and pairs `(f : ? → d, M ∈ Tm(?, A ⋅ f))`
   3. (Note : `A ⋅ ?` is obviously defined)
   4. (Note : Condition 5 is basically saying, we have `? ⊢ (σ, t) : (Γ ▷ A)` iff we have (`? ⊢ σ : Γ` and `?? ⊢ t : A[σ]`) , in the sense that we can always add stuff into explicit substitution and remove stuff from the substitution. It was clear in QIIT formulation )

(Ref 3, Lemma 3.4.7) A category with family is precisely determined by a category `𝒞` with a
terminal object `1 ∈ 𝒞` and a representable morphism `τ : Tm → Ty : PSh(𝒞)`.


basically the representable nat trans is replacing the condition 5 in the data of CwF.


* Question : Why Local Representable is equivalent to Representable Nat Transformation?

* Question : What is the `Γ ▷ Y|ₓ` mentioned in (Defn.1)?

I think it is just the pullback arised from Representable Nat Transformation in Ref 2. Because look at the structure
defined in the definition, everything aligns with the structure revealed in representable nat transformation.

So this `Γ ▷ Y|ₓ` comes from the representable object as the pullback from `x : yΓ → X` and `Y : ? → X`. 

So the question rolls back to -- why this object is using the notation `Γ ▷ Y|ₓ` ? I don't feel the presheaf over 𝒞/Γ is helpful.

Basically given `Γ : 𝒞`, `Y|ₓ : ∀ (Δ : 𝒞ᵒᵖ), 𝒞(Δ → Γ) → Set`, we have another object `Γ ▷ Y|ₓ `
