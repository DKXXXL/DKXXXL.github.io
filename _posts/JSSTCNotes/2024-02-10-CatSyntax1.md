We care about syntax, but in cat syntax, we care about their universal property
as elimination principle

are very clear about this part, basically we have two notions
1. Classifying category : For a theory 𝐿, `Mod(𝐿, 𝒞) ≅ Functor(Cl(𝐿), 𝒞)`. Basically each model corresponds to a functor from `Cl(𝐿)`, making `Cl(𝐿)` a universal notion, also called syntactic category
2. Theory-Category Correspondence. This one is stronger

We usually just looking for 1. As 1 is enough provide us with an eliminator from the syntax.

has illustrated that monad and theories has deep connection.
So we will try to investigate what monadic algebra means in each case.

# Algebra without Equations (Non Example, Intro)
Ref:

Basically, we can encode BNF/syntax as a functor `Σ`, and we can construct a free monad/functor `T` representing the syntactic category 

The universal property it has : 
Given arbitrary Σ-algebra `A = (|A|, α : Σ A → A)`, given arbitrary arrow `f : X → UA`, we have a unique Σ-algebra morphism `f# : FX → A` satisfying `U(f#) ∘ ηA = f : X → (TX = UFX) → UA`.

This can be directly read as a recursion on the Σ as the AST tree.

A Σ-algebra here standard for the recursion.

A T-algebra here ... ?

## It has a T-algebra

We can easily lift Σ algebra to T algebra, according to

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/algebra+for+an+endofunctor#relation_to_algebras_over_a_monad

consider `Σ X → X`, then `id : X → X` can lift to `T X → X` according to the above

## Note : this is not style of 1 or 2

Apparently we want to connect `Mod(𝐿, 𝒞) ≅ Functor(Cl(𝐿), 𝒞)`. But `𝐿` should be the  `Σ`. But what is model here? 

Basically I cannot sort it out.

# Equational/Algebraic Theory
It is well covered in (Ref 2, Chapter 1).
Basically for an equational theory 𝐿, `Mod(𝐿, 𝒞) ≅ FPFunc(Cl(𝐿), 𝒞)` (Ref 2, 1.9, P18). P19 also covers an explicit illustration on what the eliminator looks like.

(Where is the monad for this section?)

Interestingly, this is more similar to initial algebra than the free monad. 

# Lawvere Theory & Finitary Monad
The weirdest part about Lawvere Theory is its presentation is too far away from the usual presentation of Equational Theory
Ref
4. https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~martin/Research/Publications/2007/hp07.pdf : The Category Theoretic Understanding of Universal Algebra, P6, right before Def 2.6
5. https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/clone  Clone

These two references explain how to generate Lawvere Theory from a given notion of (signatures of) algebraic theory. Basically just `Γ ⊢ t` as an arrow `|Γ| → 1` in the syntactic category, after taking equality relation from the signature as quotient.

***

Looking closely at the definition of Lawvere Theory, this category is just the classifying/syntactic category of algebraic theory, in the last section and Ref 2.

That means, we already specify syntax via classifying category. Unlike above two sections, we always start with a conventional syntax (generator & relations).

So here we will focus on the finitary monad a lawvere theory introduces.
