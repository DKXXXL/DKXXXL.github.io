We care about syntax, but in cat syntax, we care about their universal property
as elimination principle

are very clear about this part, basically we have two notions
A. Classifying category : For a theory 𝐿, `Mod(𝐿, 𝒞) ≅ Functor(Cl(𝐿), 𝒞)`. Basically each model corresponds to a functor from `Cl(𝐿)`, making `Cl(𝐿)` a universal notion, also called syntactic category
B. Theory-Category Correspondence. This one is stronger

We usually just looking for 1. As 1 is enough provide us with an eliminator from the syntax.

has illustrated that monad and theories has deep connection.
So we will try to investigate what monadic algebra means in each case.

# Algebra without Equations (Non Example, Intro)
Ref:
3. https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/kikw8u/what_is_the_relationship_between_free_monads_and/

Basically, we can encode BNF/syntax as a functor `Σ`, and we can construct a free monad/functor `T` representing the syntactic category 

The universal property it has : 
Given arbitrary Σ-algebra `A = (|A|, α : Σ A → A)`, given arbitrary arrow `f : X → UA`, we have a unique Σ-algebra morphism `f# : FX → A` satisfying `U(f#) ∘ ηA = f : X → (TX = UFX) → UA`.

This can be directly read as a recursion on the Σ as the AST tree.

A Σ-algebra here standard for the recursion.

A T-algebra here ... ?

## It has a T-algebra

We can easily lift Σ algebra to T algebra, according to

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/algebra+for+an+endofunctor#relation_to_algebras_over_a_monad

consider `Σ X → X`, then `id : X → X` can lift to `T X → X` according to the above

## Note : this universal property is not in the style of A or B

So basically this universal property of the free monad is not the universal property I referred in 1 or 2.

According to Ref 0, the finitary monad we are focusing on has all the terms, so the finitary monad is actually the free monad we constructed above. 

According to https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/finitary+monad#finitary_monads_and_lawvere_theories, we can continue to construct
the lawvere theory.

Interestingly, in this example, we first construct finitary monad then construct the lawvere theory. So the intuition is that, finitary monad corresponds to AST trees; T-algebra corresponds to the algebra/model for those AST trees. 


And the universal property mentioned in A is about the correspondence between the model of theory and structure-preserving functors; but this universal property is about evaluation -- how evaluation on variables `X` can extend to evaluation on terms in `T X`. This later universal property doesn't even start with syntax, but a parameter variable `X`.

# Equational/Algebraic Theory
It is well covered in (Ref 2, Chapter 1).
Basically for an equational theory 𝐿, `Mod(𝐿, 𝒞) ≅ FPFunc(Cl(𝐿), 𝒞)` (Ref 2, 1.9, P18). P19 also covers an explicit illustration on what the eliminator looks like.

(Where is the monad for this section?)

Interestingly, this is more similar to initial algebra than the free monad. 

# Lawvere Theory & Finitary Monad
The weirdest part about Lawvere Theory is its presentation is too far away from the usual presentation of Equational Theory

6. https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/finitary+monad#finitary_monads_and_lawvere_theories

Ref 4 & 5 explain how to generate Lawvere Theory from a given notion of (signatures of) algebraic theory. Basically just `Γ ⊢ t` as an arrow `|Γ| → 1` in the syntactic category, after taking equality relation from the signature as quotient.

Ref 6 explains how we can construct lawvere via finitary monad; the other side is in Ref 4, still constructing AST. 

***

Looking closely at the definition of Lawvere Theory, this category is just the classifying/syntactic category of algebraic theory, in the last section and Ref 2.

That means, we already specify syntax via classifying category. Unlike above two sections, we always start with a conventional syntax (generator & relations).

# Sketch

The reason of this post is for understanding related to

Ref
7. https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10783
8. Category theory for computing science


Sketch is "strict" in the sense that, if I use FP Sketch to generate a theory, then the model will choose a product cone to realize the sketched cone. So the model will mark one specific cone. 

(Basically This sketched product cone is a structure rather than property!)

And the model homomorphism is the natural transformation, so each model will have to commute on the choice of the marked cone, by the model homomorphism.
