A **Higher Order Model** of J is defined to be the data of
```
Ty: Set

Tm: Ty Set, // locally representable

You, 4 days ago. Save.

П: V(A: Ty) (B: Tm(A) Ty) → Ty,

app: VA B (f: Tm(П(A, B))) (a: Tm(A)) lam: VA B (b: (a: Tm(A)) Tm(B(a))) Tm(B(a)), Tm(П(A, B)),

lamn: lam(λa app(f, a)) = f,

lamẞ: app(lam(b), a) = b(a)
```
There is a very important but omitted point: What is the Set mentioned in the data?

I think the paper is referring that, this data is just a bunch of stuff ready to be interpreted in an ambient category

with universe (to interpret Set) and dependent function type.

I Basically I don't think (Ref 1) emphasized enough about the ambient category of this higher order model.

# First Order Model

1. (Ref 1) **A First Order Model** of 𝒯 is defined to be a CwF 𝒞 equipped with Π-types.

1. Equivalently, A First Order Model is defined to be a category a with a terminal object 1 along with

(global) higher order model C **in

Psh(C)**

This part makes sense at this point, basically we implicit assume higher order model can gives us a first order model locate in the classical set world, and

But this idea breaks on 52.4, as we are talking about first order model internal to Psh(C), so the above implicit assumption doesn't make sense.

In §3.1, we also have a similar problem as first order should look like. Ty: M.Con Set, but this Set again we don't know how to interpret it... It should be the universe in the ambient category,

But this data form, I cannot easy connect it with the above definition because above definition doesn't seem

to mention any ambient category!** 

2. Question: When is the ambient category referred to in the first two definitions of first order model*?

3. §2.4, mentions

> the notion of first-order model is described by an essentially algebraic theory, it can be interpreted in any finitely complete category

1. again, when is the ambient category mentioned in this definition?

***

I

To continue the discussion, we conjecture what the paper means is also:

A First Order Model of 𝒯 is defined to be the data of
```
Con : Set

1 : Con

Ty: Con → Set

Tm: (Г: Con) → Ty Γ → Set,

Sub: Con → Con → Set
```
