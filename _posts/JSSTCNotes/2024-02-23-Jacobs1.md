## Morphism between Fibration/ Fibred Functor : Definition 1.7.1, or https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/fibred+functor 

Basically functor preserves cartesian morphism.

## Simple Fibration
Given `T ⊆ 𝔹₀`,
`s(T)` objects : (Γ ∈ 𝔹, X ∈ T) 
morphisms : (Γ, X) → (Δ, Y) is
  u : Γ → Δ and f : Γ × X → Y

## Fibred Functor preserves product/coproduct : Definition 1.9.13
For `p : 𝔼 → 𝔹, q : 𝔻 → 𝔸`, `H := (K, L) : p → q` is a fibred functor, i.e. `K : 𝔹 → 𝔸`

Basically, because fibred functor `H := (K, L) : p → q` preserves cartesian morphism, 

so we have
` K ∘ p = q ∘ L`, this commutation/equation alone is enough 
to make sure `K` always map fibred category to fibred category.

So we can consider `H` as a functor, for each `I ∈ 𝔹` between fibred category `𝔼_I → 𝔻_(K I)`.
Now that `H` is a functor between fibred category, this makes it possible to talk about preserve simple products, 
but apparently we need `K(I × J) ≅ K I × K J` on the base category.

## What Preserve Simple Product

Currently we have reindexed functor, and fibred functor preserve simple product (fibrewise).
The former one is called Beck-Chevalley condition, to make product compatible with substitution, Definition 1.9.1.

## Fibrewise Construction is not mentioned in Chapter 2
Weird.

# Lemma 1.7.6
1. by K : (𝔸, S) → (𝔹, T), we automatically have the commutation in fibred functor.
2. Because K preserves product (not necessary on the nose), so we have `γ : K (A) × K (B) ≅ K(A × B)`
3. each cartesian lifting in simple fibration for `u ∈ 𝔸₁`, is exactly `(u, π)`
4. the challenge is to use γ to make a fibered functor to preserve split on the nose.

# Lemma 2.4.7
<!-- We can understand this lemma is sort of about internal language -->
