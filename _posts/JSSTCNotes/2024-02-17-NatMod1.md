# Natural Model as Cat Syntax

To properly use Natural Model as Categorical Syntax and achieve HOAS syntax, we need to understand the following
1. extend Natural Model with new type/term former 
  1. via using HOAS signature (Ref 3, Ref 4)
  2. via giving new concrete categorical construction (Ref 1, Ref 2)
  3. for 1, we still need to sort out the concrete cat construction
2. construct specific Natural Model (to possibly construct consistency/canonicity/normalization model)
  1. stable class of maps (Ref 2)
  2. Local Universe Construction, "Promoting universe to a model" (Ref 5, Ref 7) 
3. Free Natural Model
  1. so that for 1, we can construct syntactic nat model using especially 1.1 (Ref 1, Ref 3, Ref 4)
  2. and connect 1 and 2 (Ref 5, Ref 7)
4. Model Morphism on the nose (Ref 5, Ref 7)
  1. For example, if we have syntax `ùíÆ.‚ä•`, and we have construct a consistency (set) model `‚Ñ≥.‚ä• = ‚àÖ`,
  2. then by freeness, we have `F : ùíÆ ‚Üí ‚Ñ≥`, but we have to have `F(ùíÆ.‚ä•) = ‚Ñ≥.‚ä•` to achieve the proof of consistency
  3. When I say on the nose, I still mean in HOAS syntax, e.g., compute the morphism result `F(Œª x. y)` using morphism `F` on a lambda term using HOAS syntax (Ref 8) 
     1. or at least be able to compute `F(bool)` and `F(Œ† A B)` because they are where motives store


The ultimate goal is remove all/most substitution lemma verification in model construction.

# Apparent Alternative : Make it first order

Nat Model is equivalent to CwF in first order form, actually (Ref 1, ¬ß 2.2) already shows it. 


***
After these, we can start to consider internalize a Natural Model signature (1.1) inside certain presheaf category.
