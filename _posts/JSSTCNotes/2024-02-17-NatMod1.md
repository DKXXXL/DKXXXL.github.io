# Natural Model as Cat Syntax

To properly use Natural Model as Categorical Syntax and achieve HOAS syntax, we need to understand the following
1. extend Natural Model with new type/term former 
  1. via using HOAS signature (Ref 3, Ref 4)
  2. via giving new concrete categorical construction (Ref 1, Ref 2)
  3. for 1, we still need to sort out the concrete cat construction
2. construct specific Natural Model (to possibly construct consistency/canonicity/normalization model)
  1. stable class of maps (Ref 2)
  2. Local Universe Construction, "Promoting universe to a model" (Ref 5, Ref 6, Ref 7) 
3. Free Natural Model
  1. so that for 1, we can construct syntactic nat model using especially 1.1 (Ref 1, Ref 3, Ref 4)
  2. and connect 1 and 2 (Ref 5, Ref 7)
4. Model Morphism on the nose (Ref 5, Ref 7)
  1. For example, if we have syntax `𝒮.⊥`, and we have construct a consistency (set) model `ℳ.⊥ = ∅`,
  2. then by freeness, we have `F : 𝒮 → ℳ`, but we have to have `F(𝒮.⊥) = ℳ.⊥` to achieve the proof of consistency
  3. When I say on the nose, I still mean in HOAS syntax, e.g., compute the morphism result `F(λ x. y)` using morphism `F` on a lambda term using HOAS syntax (Ref 8) (Ref 1, Lemma 2.3.18) 
     1. or at least be able to compute `F(bool)` and `F(Π A B)` at type level because they are where motives store
     2. we have this in (Ref 9), because (Ref 9, 1.4∗10, §3.7), we need something similar for nat model


The ultimate goal is remove all/most substitution lemma verification in model construction.

# Apparent Alternative : Make it first order

Nat Model is equivalent to CwF in first order form, actually (Ref 1, § 2.2) already shows it. 

## Can we just generate the first order (GAT/EAT) specification from HOAS spec?

Yes, because (Ref 1, § 2.2) uses essential algebraic theory. 
We can also use QIIT, intuitively each line of signature corresponds to a line in QIIT spec.

Then we have free Nat Model and Nat Model homomorphism, preserving stuff on the nose. 

The final problem is how to construct the consistency/canonicity model via HOAS/Nat Model without 
verifying subst lemma. (i.e. 2 in the above)

# Nat Model in (Ref 7)
Basically, (Ref 7, Lemma 4.3.2) says
> Lemma 4.3.2. (Ty∗,Tm∗) is closed under dependent products
> Proof. Unfolding the statement of this lemma, we must construct terms ..

Basically it is a good news that, the definition of "closed under dependent product" directly unfold to the two constants;
similar for boolean type. (Similar for Lemma 4.3.3).

But we still need double check about this -- can we directly use constant as the spec in §3.4?

## Morphism computation in (Ref 7)

In (Ref 9), we have the `Mod(𝕊, ℰ) ≅ LCCC(T/𝕊, ℰ)`, to make sure we can compute the LCCC functor according to 𝕊-algebra (Ref 9, §3.7). We need something similar for nat model.

Also the initiality is weird, we have some machinery in (Ref 7, §4.2)

***
After these, we can start to consider internalize a Natural Model signature (1.1) inside certain presheaf category.
