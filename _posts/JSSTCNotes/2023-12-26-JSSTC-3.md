Three aims, everything below mentioned in JS-thesis we need an investigation: 
1. Understanding Classifying topos AND GEOMETRIC THEORIES (§2.2)
2. Understanding open/close subtopos
3. Everything about §5.5.2∗2, including §2.3.1
4. How modalities on universe and functors on topos related?
5. When doing two syntax pieces like Parametricity, how to glue? (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08599) 
   1. the copower of syntax
***
1 is too hard. Let's try to read the following before diving in

3. let's trying to understand the examples in §2.2
   1. using references above

# Review § 2.2

* (§ 2.2 ∗ 5) Recall (Ref 4 §X.1, §X.2) has the properly defined of `Mod(𝑇, ℰ)`. 
  * So to interpret an empty theory, we will interpret no sort, no function, no relation, no axioms
  * Thus for each topos ℰ, there is only one way to intepret it, thus only one model

* (§2.2.1∗1) its points are sets simply because a model of this theory in the category of sets is just a set; thus Hom(𝟙, 𝔸) are the sets 
* (§2.2.2∗1), Recall (Ref 4 §X.1, §X.2) has the properly defined of `Mod(𝑇, ℰ)` and `Mod(𝑇, ℰ) ≅ Hom(ℰ, Cl(𝑇))`. if `𝑇` has a sort `V` and a constant `v : V`, then by the universal model `M ∈ Mod(𝑇, Cl(𝑇))`,
`Vᴹ ∈ Cl(𝑇)` as an object and `vᴹ` as a morphism, thus in the internal language of `Cl(𝑇)`, we will have `Vᴹ`as type and `vᴹ` as a term.


# Review Open/Close Subtopos

1. Review §3.6, what is 𝒰¶ and 𝒰\¶ ?
2. We know artin gluing is gluing arbitrary two topos, and each will be the open and closed subtopos
   1. so for the arbitrary type, say Ω， in each topos, how are they mapped into the open/closed subtopos
   2. how are they in the big topos?
   3. what about the other types/objects? 




* (3.6∗2) is hard. I have asked around and got some comments
```
EDJ : Thanks! Also why is 1X "an internal representation of the entire space X"?
Also "U is an internal category of (small) sheaves on the point 1X", is it because I should think of U and 1X both as logos, and thus the terminal map U → 1X is a model of U where sorts are interpreted as sheaves on 1X?

J : What I am alluding here is the way that the theory of topoi varies over a base logos. Up to size issues, you can think of it as "topos theory internal to a logos".
What's happening here is that if the base logos is Sh(X), the internal topos corresponding to X is given by taking internal sheaves on 1.
What's happening is that from the point of view of "Topos theory over Sh(X)", the internal point is, when externalized, actually X.

EDJ : 绝望的文盲完全看不懂
Z:  ok，我看起来是这样：平时我们说的topos theory都是在set theory上建立的嘛，但如果我们在Sh(X)上重新解读topos theory，那么就可以考虑在terminal object (which has a internal preorder)上的(internal) sheaf topos。然后这个internal topos的externalisation就和本来的Sh(X)一样
EDJ : 第一句话可以细讲一下吗 我平常看topos就看成一个logos的，logos就是一个范畴，
所以我不知道为啥是建立在set theory上的
Z : 就是我们平时说sheaf category都是sheaves over some sites嘛，比如特别一点sheaves over some preorder
然后preorders指的是普通的preorders in set theory, 也就是 internal preorders in the category of sets
但那句话是说，我们有一个sheaf topos X，然后它（的logos）里面不是有个terminal object 1嘛，然后这个terminal object也是一个internal preorder，那我们也可以考虑 internal sheaves over this preorder 1呀
internal sheaves和sheaves的定义一样，只是所有的构造都搬到Sh(X)里做
然后上面Sterling和你说话的截图里他说这个internal sheaf category over 1的externalisation和原本的sheaf topos X是一样的
我觉得其实这一段并不是特别关键啦，属于比较high level的观点。证明里其实并不会用到

EDJ : 这里的preorder是不是就是topological space里的inclusion啊
Z : 是
```

Too many questions here to be honest，a lot of definition is omitted. What is a topos theory over another theory? Why is it equivalent to internal topos theory? Why its externalization is equivalent to...?  We will not collect all the questions, not until we have a proper understanding of topos theory.

4. Chapter 7 in: Categorical Logic and Type Theory,


* (§3.6∗4) Basically `𝒰¶` is a realignment of `¶ → 𝒰`, where the latter we know is the open universe
  * concretely, `𝒰¶ := realign [ ¶ → 𝒰 | ¶ ↪ (𝒰, ...) ]`, simply because, under `¶`, `𝒰 ≅ ¶ → 𝒰`


* Question : The two modality ⚈ in (§3.6∗7) and , how are they the same? 
  * i.e. There is actually four modalities, but working on different settings, one as functor the other as function on universe. We use `𝒰` as the universe, `𝒢` as the glued topos, from `X, Y` two topos
  * Question : for `A : 𝒰`, is `○A ≅ ¶ → A`?
  * Question : for `A ∈ 𝒢`, is `○A ≅ ¶ → A`? (apparently, this ¶ is the )
  * Question : for `A : 𝒰`, denote `⌜A⌝ : 𝒢` as the type, we want `⌜○A⌝ ≅ ○⌜A⌝` an equivalence between two (dependnet type)
  * The above three questions, but for ⚈ as the modality correspondingly
  * Question : for `A : 𝒰`, is `○⚈A ≅ 1`?
  * Question : for `A ∈ 𝒢`, is `○⚈A ≅ 1`?
  * Question : for `A ∈ Y` as an object, we have `i_* Y ∈ 𝒢`, we want to show `○ (i_* Y) ≅ 1`
  * Question : for each modality, we have decompostion either from §3.6 like functiosn `¶* : 𝒰 → 𝒰¶` or functors `i_* : Y → 𝒢`, totally 8 operators. Can we find their equivalence?
  * How is `𝒰 ∈ X` and `𝒰 ∈ Y` related to `𝒰,𝒰¶, 𝒰\¶ ∈ 𝒢`?
