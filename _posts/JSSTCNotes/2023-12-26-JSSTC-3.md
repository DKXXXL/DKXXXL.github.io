Three aims, everything below mentioned in JS-thesis we need an investigation: 
1. Understanding Classifying topos AND GEOMETRIC THEORIES (§2.2)
2. Understanding open/close subtopos
3. Everything about §5.5.2∗2, including §2.3.1

***
1 is too hard. Let's try to read the following before diving in

Ref 
1. Handbook of Categorical Algebra 
   1. https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Handbook+of+Categorical+Algebra
   2. especially volumn 3
2. Sketches of an Elephant
   1. https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Sketches+of+an+Elephant
   2. especially volumn D

3. let's trying to understand the examples in §2.2
   1. using references above

# Review § 2.2

* (§ 2.2 ∗ 5) Recall (Ref 4 §X.1, §X.2) has the properly defined of `Mod(𝑇, ℰ)`. 
  * So to interpret an empty theory, we will interpret no sort, no function, no relation, no axioms
  * Thus for each topos ℰ, there is only one way to intepret it, thus only one model

* (§2.2.1∗1) its points are sets simply because a model of this theory in the category of sets is just a set; thus Hom(𝟙, 𝔸) are the sets 
* (§2.2.2∗1), Recall (Ref 4 §X.1, §X.2) has the properly defined of `Mod(𝑇, ℰ)` and `Mod(𝑇, ℰ) ≅ Hom(ℰ, Cl(𝑇))`. if `𝑇` has a sort `V` and a constant `v : V`, then by the universal model `M ∈ Mod(𝑇, Cl(𝑇))`,
`Vᴹ ∈ Cl(𝑇)` as an object and `vᴹ` as a morphism, thus in the internal language of `Cl(𝑇)`, we will have `Vᴹ`as type and `vᴹ` as a term.


# Review Open/Close Subtopos

1. Review §3.6, what is 𝒰¶ and 𝒰\¶ ?
2. We know artin gluing is gluing arbitrary two topos, and each will be the open and closed subtopos
   1. so for the arbitrary type, say Ω， in each topos, how are they mapped into the open/closed subtopos
   2. how are they in the big topos?
   3. what about the other types/objects?
