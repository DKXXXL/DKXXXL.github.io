Final lecture note of MAT347 Winter 2021. 
# Galois Theory
* If $K/F$ is a field extension
  * $\langle Aut(K), \circ \rangle$ is the group of automorphism (field homomorphism)
### Definition: $Aut(K/F)$
* $Aut(K/F)$ is a subgroup of those automorphism that fix $F$
    * i.e. $\sigma x = x \quad \forall x \in F$
* For any $K, F$, $id \in Aut(K/F)$
***
* $\Complex / R$ where $z \mapsto \overline{z}$ fixed $R$
  * so conjugation is an element of $Aut(\Complex/R)$
***
* Prime Field in $K$ is generated by $1$
  * if $\sigma \in Aut(K), \sigma 1 = 1$
  * thus $\sigma$ fixed the prime field
* Thus $Aut(K) = Aut(K/K_{prime})$
***
### Prop: 
* Suppose $K/F$ and $a \in K$ is algebraic over $F$
  * if $\sigma \in Aut(K/F)$
    * then $\sigma a$ is a root of $\min_{a,F}(x)$
      * which is $g \in F[x]$ s.t. $g(a) = 0$
* An example is $x^2 + 1 = 0$ has conjugated roots
* the reason is that you can apply $\sigma$ to it and by homomorphism you can see that
***
* If we live in a ground field $F$,
  * $f\in F[x]$ if $f(a) = 0$ then $f(\sigma a) = 0$
    * you cannot easily distinguish by using language like $f$ 
      * using term from lower field
### Prop:
* Suppose $H \subseteq Aut(K)$
  * Define $F_H = \{x \in K : \sigma x = x \quad \forall \sigma \in H\}$
    * then $F_H$ is a subfield of $K$
      * $F_H$ is the fixed field of $H$
***
* If $F$ is a subfield of $K$ is a subfield
  * then we can associate $Aut(K/F)$ to $F$
## Galois Theory: Association between Subgroup of $Aut(K)$ and subfields of $K$
* Easy : reverses inclusions: smaller fields corresponds to bigger subgroup
### Prop:
* Suppose $E$ is the splitting field of $f(x) \in F[x]$ (contains all the roots of $f$)
  * then $|Aut(E/F)| \le [E : F]$
  * $|Aut(E/F)| = [E:F] \iff f(x)$ is separable (can become linear factors, splits completely $E$) (???)
    * separable : its roots are distinct in an algebraic closure of K, that is, the number of distinct roots is equal to the degree of the polynomial
    * only one issue in character = p
* proof: $F(a) \mapsto F(\sigma a)$ will be extends to $E \mapsto E$

### Definition: Galois Extension
* A finite extension $K/F$ is galois (A Galois Extension) iff $Aut(K/F) = [K:F]$
* In that case $Aut(K/F)$ is called Galois Group of $K/F$
* Example:
  * $\Complex/R$ where $\sigma : z \mapsto \overline{z}$
    * $Aut(\Complex/R) = Gal(\Complex/R) = \{e, \sigma\}$
    * $[\Complex : R] = 2 = |Aut(\Complex / R)|$
  * $Q[\sqrt{d}]/Q$ is of degree 2
    * then $Aut(Q(\sqrt{d}/Q)) = \{e, x+\sqrt{d} \mapsto x - y \sqrt{d}\}$
***
* Example: Galois Theory
* ![](/assets/img/2021-04-08-16-47-38.png)
  * there are some Galois Extension inside the picture
  * normal extension ~normal subgroup
    * quotient on the normal subgroup ~ galois group
    * section 14
***
* $f(x) \in F[x]$
  * if take $a^{\frac{1}{m}}$, we will have an extension $a^{\frac{1}{m}}$
    * cyclic extension on galois group 
    * ![](/assets/img/2021-04-08-16-57-43.png)
    * requiring galois group is a solvable group
    * $S_2,S_3, S_4$ are solvable, but $S_5$ is not
      * but "most" of 5-th power has $S_5$ as Galois Group
* Legend says Galois finish all these in one night
