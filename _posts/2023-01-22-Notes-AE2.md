References is like before:
1. What is algebraic about algebraic effects and handlers? https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05923 [AB]
2. The Logic and Handling of Algebraic Effects by Matija Pretnar [Pretnar]

Other references are either not tutorial/introduction friendly enough or just with weird notation. For example
3. Plotkin, Gordon, and John Power. "Semantics for algebraic operations." Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 45 (2001): 332-345. [PP]
4. Algebraic theory of type-and-effect systems by Ohad Kammar [Kammar]

And our aim is to formalize 
5. Abstraction-Safe Effect Handlers via Tunneling [ZA] This is the main target
6. Binders by Day, Labels by Night Effect Instances via Lexically Scoped Handlers [BPPS]
6. First-class Named Effect Handlers [XCL]
***

We will start with big-step operational semantic (closer to denotational semantic). 
And 
1. either prove its soundness w.r.t. small-step
2. or prove computational adequacy w.r.t. the [Pretnar] Semantic in handler
3. doing abstraction on the semantic domain used by big-step to see how categorical stuff comes in

## Lexically scoped (capability based) non-resumable exception handler

Γ ctx
Δ capability ctx

The following three is the basic idea

Judgements:
Γ | ϵ₁ .. ⊢ e : T / {ϵₙ , ..}
Γ | ϵ₁ .. ⊢ ϵₙ Exception


should be interpreted as an arrow from LHS to〚T〛+ {ϵₙ , ..}

Sketches of two important rules:

  Γ | .. ϵᵢ .. ⊢ ϵᵢ Exception
/----------------------------------------(Exception)
  Γ | .. ϵᵢ .. ⊢ raise ϵᵢ : 0 / {ϵᵢ} 

  Γ | Δ, ϵ ⊢ e : T / E₁   Γ | Δ ⊢ h : T / E₂ 
  ϵ is absent from T; E' = E₁ ∪ E₂ \ {ϵ}
/----------------------------------------(Try)
  Γ | Δ ⊢ try[ϵ] e h : T / E'


The above are statics, the dynamics look likes open-reduction. i.e. ultimately we have

`try[ϵ] (raise ϵ) h ≡ h`

the big-step semantic for it looks like 

  e ⇊ raise ϵ
/---------------------
  try[ϵ] e h ⇊ h

It seems 


Let's QIIT it!

### Syntax
