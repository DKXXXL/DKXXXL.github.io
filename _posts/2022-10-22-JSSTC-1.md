This post is to review
1. First Steps in Synthetic Tait Computability: The Objective Metatheory of Cubical Type Theory
2. Naive Synthetic Tait Computability

The motivation is to understand how to use STLC to prove all sorts of logical relation, though Ref 2 is already very clear 

For that, we still do a review. We need to figure out
1. The new connectives, including refinement/realignment, modal operator from subuniverses, in the internal language
2. how to use them
3. The intuition of these new type connectives, so that programming can be easier
   1. though maybe it is just
   2. another way is to unfold the internal language (during the proof) to see what concrete logical relation each intern language argument stands for
4. How to rephrase the canonicity/normalization into the internal language so that we can start program
5. how to unfold the constructed model from internal language to conventional math, so that we are clear we are proving canonicity/normalization
6. how to use this to prove other property like parametricity and etc.

This above is about practical usage of that example, but not enough, we still need to know
1. why the new connectives are justified in the internal language
   1. especially the refinement, we need to figure out the detailed theorem that state the construction of refinement
2. Why postulates in Ref2 are justified?
3. How to alter the postulates and the working topos for different language like System F, System F omega, CBPV?
