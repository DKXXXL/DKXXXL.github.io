This post is to review
1. First Steps in Synthetic Tait Computability: The Objective Metatheory of Cubical Type Theory
2. Naive Synthetic Tait Computability
3. [Natural models of homotopy type theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3219)

The motivation is to understand how to use STLC to prove all sorts of logical relation, though Ref 2 is already very clear but there are still a lot of unclear parts:
1. What are the new connectives, including refinement/realignment, modal operator from subuniverses, in the internal language
2. how to use them
3. The intuition of these new type connectives, so that programming can be easier
   1. another way is to unfold the internal language (during the proof) to see what concrete logical relation each intern language argument stands for
4. How to rephrase the canonicity/normalization into the internal language so that we can start program
5. how to unfold the constructed model from internal language to conventional math, so that we are clear we are proving canonicity/normalization
6. how to use this to prove other property like parametricity and etc.
7. Why we can use HOAS in LF and get universal property from it?
   1. Gratzer/Sterling's Sketching + Adequacy paper, but it is not necessary
   2. https://twitter.com/KesDinmond/status/1584359412273410049

This above is about practical usage of that example, but not enough, we still need to know
1. why the new connectives are justified in the internal language
   1. especially the refinement, we need to figure out the detailed theorem that state the construction of refinement
2. Why postulates in Ref2 are justified?
3. How to alter the postulates and the working topos for different language like System F, System F omega, CBPV?

# However, these questions are too far stray from  our main motivation.

To understand STC, there are mainly three parts to concern
1. How to understand the syntax/semantic model styled in LF?
   1. Usually when using conventional math, either named variable or debruijn indices, it is quite close to QIIT, full of judgement, derivation, context and etc
   2. The users are programming using this syntax as well, with context clearly acknowledged 
   3. But in LF, we don't have context anymore! Look at (Ref 1) Figure 1.2 ; there 
   4. If we use LF to design our "syntax", then it leaves the question -- what is the actual syntax the progammer is using to program? Definitely now the LF one, right? Because of lack of context
   5. What's more, LF is violating strictly positivity, thus it is not generally an inital algebra of something. So when Sterling says free LCCC/universal property/Lawvere syntax, what does it mean? How free/universal is that? What can we eliminate to using this syntax?
   6. What's more, from (Ref 1) Sec 4.4, the canonicity model is given by programming in this LF style! Then how concretely (what categorical construction) is this model constructed? How does the model look like? 
2. How to make sure we are safely using those new connectives in LF?
   1. This is generally related the refinement/realignment in (Ref 1) Sec 3.3
   2. The main problem is, we know this refinment connective exists here, but what is the general precise condition this connective exists?
      1. And how can we transplant this to other places?
3. How to unfold the semantic model styled in LF to a proof of canonicity/normalization? Or how to embed a proof goal back into LF style?
   1. This is located in (Ref 1) 4.5.2*3, 
      1. demonstrated how a proof/term of type 1 ‚Üí ‚öà((b = tt) + (b = ff)) can already gives us a proof term 1 ‚Üí ((b = tt) + (b = ff))
   2. usually this is the other way around -- how do we make sure, say `1 ‚Üí ‚öà((b = tt) + (b = ff))` is the thing we want to prove?

In fact, Question 1 is intuitively hinted by (Ref 1) Sec 3.7*3. As Sterling computes one example of the free model for us, the ML‚àÖ. Looking closing, this ML‚àÖ, syntactically, is almost identical to the `‚àë tp :ùïå, tp ‚Üí ùïå` but cautious! It is not a type theory but an internal language of a category theory, so what is that `tp: ùïå`? 

In fact, this is deeply related to (Ref 3), and actually there are a lot of places in the thesis using (Ref 3), so (Ref 3) is a must-read prerequsite for STC.

Roughly, speaking, this `ùïå` called Universe, demonstrated how a category with family(CWF) is generated. So  `ML‚àÖ ‚âÖ ‚àë tp :ùïå, tp ‚Üí ùïå` already tells us what this type theory with context information/judgement looks like.

Basically to understand LF style proof, we need to translate it back to analytic style proof formulated in QIIT.


A lot of the question here is already be answered in (Ref 2) for sure, but I don't think it is very clear or understandable.
