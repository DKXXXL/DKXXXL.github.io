# Notes on Category Theory, __3__.

## Natural Transformation are arrows of arrows
Or more explicitly, natural transformations are the arrows in the category where objects are functors.

Can you guess the definition of natural transformation? 

If not, do you remember the definition of the arrow category? 


## Monic components induce monic natural transformation

It is a very trivial part but I want to go through the details of this proof.
