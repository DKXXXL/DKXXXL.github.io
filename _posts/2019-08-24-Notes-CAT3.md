## Natural Transformation are arrows of arrows
Or more explicitly, natural transformations are the arrows in the category where objects are functors.

Can you guess the definition of natural transformation? 

If not, do you remember the definition of the arrow category? 


## Monic components induce monic natural transformation
It is a very trivial part but I want to go through the details of this proof.

> Claim: If natural transformation $\eta$, where $\eta_X$ is monoic for any object $X$, 
> then $\eta$ is monoic as well.

## Example: 'Models' 

Barrs and Wells define a concept 'model'. A model for a graph is a graph homomorphism from that graph to **Set**. It seems very trivial.

Before proceed, we define a set with structure $(S, u:S \rightarrow S)$. Intuitively, a homomophism $h: (S_1, u_1) \rightarrow (S_2, u_2)$ is just a function satisfying $h \circ u_1 = u_2 \circ h$.

Now we can draw a graph to indicate that structure. Simply a node $S'$ with a self loop labeled $u'$. The graph is named as ${\cal S}$. Now consider the category where objects are the models of ${\cal S}$. Then what are the arrows? We know a graph homomorphism is not yet a functor, but we can always force those arrows to be 'natural transformation' to some extent. Taking arbitrary $\eta : F \rightarrow G$ where $F,G$ are both models, the following diagram commute:

Surprisingly, $\eta_{S'}$ is exactly a homomorphism as we defined. We somehow derive the definition of the homomorphism.

The name for this concept "model" become clear: we use model to interpret this graph just as we use model to interpret a sentence in any logic theory, which yield a class of mathematical object with certain structure. Furthermore, Barrs and Wells say the category of the models are 'essentially the same' as the category of thost $(S,u)$ structure.

'Model' also gives us alternative way to interpret: we can let codomain be some category other than **Set**. In that way, we say "model in __ category".

## Sketches are just "formal signatures".

Maybe "formal signature" is a bit confusing. It is just how "language" and "theory" is to "first order logic", as we did in the example of 'Models'. When the author wants to prove something in category theory or express the structure of some categories, the author would choose to draw a diagram, a graph in the book to illustrate. However, sketch is the formalilzation of these aids (these graphs). These aids, once was a part of meta-language and acceptable to be a little informal and now becomes a mathematical object.

#### Formalization of 'Diagrams'

*(The following summary might be incorrect.)*

More specifically, Barr and Wells first formalize the diagram as a graph homomorphism, where domain is called shape graph. If a diagram has codomain ${\cal G}$, we say 'that diagram in ${\cal G}$'.

I cannot see any special reason to do so. However, to define 'commutative diagram' on this definition is easy. Once the codomain of the diagram (graph homomorphism) is an underlying graph of a category, we say that diagram commutes if all the path in the shape graph with same beginning and end will map to and compose into equal arrow. For example, in shape graph of diagram ${\cal t}$, non-trivial $\{a_i\}^n, \{b_i\}^m$ are edges of paths with same start and end, then $t(a_1) \circ ... \circ t(a_n) = t(b_1) \circ ... \circ t(b_m)$. 

Addtionally, a loop on a node (as a path) has to be mapped to $id$ arrow. 

What's more, in the book, the author also draw pictures (which are graphs) to represent diagrams (yet again another meta-language, despite no ambiguity). And by convention, the shape/figure of the drawn graph indicates shape graph, and the labels indicate to what the node is mapped to. So you will see some drawn picture with two nodes as same name, which indicate the different nodes of the shape graph has been mapped to same nodes.



I won't go into the details of the theories of sketches because (1). it is itself very abstract and thus time consuming to understand, (2) when a new object is introduced there are tons of new congruences needed to verify, which is again very time-consuming, (3) I feel a little too vague working on those mathematical objects:
>   A model of the underlying linear sketch $E$ in some category $C$ is the same as a functor on the original category: on the one hand, any functor takes any commutative diagram to a commutative diagram and so is a model ...

This is a part from *Barr and Wells*, which I find not satisfactory because it is a little too informal for me.

I won't go into details about sketches because my ultimate goal of category studying has becoming categorical semantic of type theory.
