## Natural Transformation are arrows of arrows
Or more explicitly, natural transformations are the arrows in the category where objects are functors.

Can you guess the definition of natural transformation? 

If not, do you remember the definition of the arrow category? 


## Monic components induce monic natural transformation
It is a very trivial part but I want to go through the details of this proof.

## From Yoneda Embedding ... 
Yoneda Embedding is said to be a generalization of cayley theorem, which I don't know if is true since I never learned group theory. And an important theorem about Yoneda Embedding can also be generalized to Yoneda Lemma. 

Functor $Y: {\cal C}^{op} \rightarrow {\textbf{Func}({\cal C}, \textbf{Set})}$ is Yoneda Embedding, where $\{\textbf{Func}({\cal C}, \textbf{Set})\}$ is the category where the objects are functors and arrows are natural transformations. 

Specifically, $Y(C) := Hom_{\cal C}(C, \cdot)$. Let's see what definition can make it into a functor. For arbitrary arrow $f:A \rightarrow B \in {\cal C}$, we have $f':B \rightarrow A \in {\cal C}^{op}$. Then $Y(f') : Hom(B, \cdot) \rightarrow Hom(A, \cdot) : {\cal C} \rightarrow \textbf{Set}$. Thus $Y(f')$ has to be a family of arrows s.t. the following commutative diagram holds

It is easy to see that $Y(f')(X) := \{ g \mapsto g \circ f\}$ can make this diagram commute and the truth is Yoneda Embedding is defined like it.

Now we can come to the important theorem.

> $Y$ is full and faithful. In other words, for arbitrary $C,D \in {\cal C}$,
> 
> Those $Hom_{\cal C}(C, \cdot) \rightarrow Hom_{\cal C}(D, \cdot)$ 1-to-1 correspond those $C \rightarrow D$.
> 
> Due to *3.3.11 of Barr and Wells*, thus $Hom_{\cal C}(C, \cdot) \cong Hom_{\cal C}(D, \cdot)$ implies $C \cong D$.

#### Proof of full and faithful.

<details>
    <summary>To Show Full:</summary>
    <p>
        Take arbitrary $\eta :Hom_{\cal C}(C,\cdot) \rightarrow Hom_{\cal C}(D, \cdot)$, we claim that 

        $$Y(\eta_C(id_C)) =^? \eta$$

        To show which, in turn we need take arbitrary $X \in {\cal C}$ and (since $Hom{\cal C}(C,X)$ thank-god is a set) an arbitrary arrow $f\in Hom_{{\cal C}}(C,X)$,  

        $$Y(\eta_C(id_C))_X(f) =^? \eta_X(f)$$

        To show which, by simplification, we need

        $$f \circ (\eta_C(id_C)) =^? \eta_X(f)$$ and we have the following commute diagram since we have $\eta$ as natural transformation:

$\blacksquare$

This is the theorem which is a generalization of cayley theorem.



## ... to Yoneda Lemma

It is not easy to see that the theorem can be generalized further.

> Let $F : {\cal C} \rightarrow \textbf{Set}$ be a set-valued functor,
> 
> Those $Hom_{\cal C}(C, \cdot) \rightarrow F$ 1-to-1 correspond those in $F(C)$.

By take $F = Hom_{\cal C}(D, \cdot)$, we can get the above theorem. But this correpondence is no longer relevent to any functor, i.e. it is not a correspondence between arrows of category, but just a bijection between sets.

## Representable Functor / Universal Elements
A set-valued functor, $F : {\cal C} \rightarrow Set$, is representable if $F$ is naturally isomorphic to $Hom_{\cal C}(C, \cdot)$ for some object $C$ in ${\cal C}$. In that case, we will also say $C$ represents $F$.

Note that, if $F$ contravariant, then the hom functor would be $Hom_{\cal C}(\cdot, C)$. 

What's more, a representable functor is witnessed by a universal element.

## Sketches are just "formal signatures".

Maybe "formal signature" is a bit confusing. It is just how "language" and "theory" is to "first order logic".  I can take an example to elaborate that. When the author wants to prove something in category theory or express the structure of some categories, the author would choose to draw a diagram, a graph in the book to illustrate. However, sketch is the formalilzation of these aids (these graphs). These aids, once was a part of meta-language and acceptable to be a little informal and now becomes a mathematical object. I won't go into the details of the theories of sketches because (1). it is itself very abstract and thus time consuming to understand, (2) when a new object is introduced there are tons of new congruences needed to verify, which is again very time-consuming, (3) I feel a little too vague working on those mathematical objects:
>   A model of the underlying linear sketch $E$ in some category $C$ is the same as a functor on the original category: on the one hand, any functor takes any commutative diagram to a commutative diagram and so is a model ...

This is a part from *Barr and Wells*, which I find not satisfactory because it is a little too informal for me.

I won't go into details about sketches because my ultimate goal of category studying has becoming categorical semantic of type theory.
