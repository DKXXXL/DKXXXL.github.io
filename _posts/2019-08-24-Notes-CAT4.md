## From Yoneda Embedding ... 
Yoneda Embedding is said to be a generalization of cayley theorem, which I don't know if is true since I never learned group theory. And an important theorem about Yoneda Embedding can also be generalized to Yoneda Lemma. 

Functor $Y: {\cal C}^{op} \rightarrow {\textbf{Func}({\cal C}, \textbf{Set})}$ is Yoneda Embedding, where $\{\textbf{Func}({\cal C}, \textbf{Set})\}$ is the category where the objects are functors and arrows are natural transformations. 

Specifically, $Y(C) := Hom_{\cal C}(C, \cdot)$. Let's see what definition can make it into a functor. For arbitrary arrow $f:A \rightarrow B \in {\cal C}$, we have $f':B \rightarrow A \in {\cal C}^{op}$. Then $Y(f') : Hom(B, \cdot) \rightarrow Hom(A, \cdot) : {\cal C} \rightarrow \textbf{Set}$. Thus $Y(f')$ has to be a family of arrows s.t. the following commutative diagram holds

It is easy to see that $Y(f')(X) := \{ g \mapsto g \circ f\}$ can make this diagram commute and the truth is Yoneda Embedding is defined like it.

Now we can come to the important theorem.

> $Y$ is full and faithful. In other words, for arbitrary $C,D \in {\cal C}$,
> 
> Those $Hom_{\cal C}(C, \cdot) \rightarrow Hom_{\cal C}(D, \cdot)$ 1-to-1 correspond those $C \rightarrow D$.
> 
> Due to *3.3.11 of Barr and Wells*, thus $Hom_{\cal C}(C, \cdot) \cong Hom_{\cal C}(D, \cdot)$ implies $C \cong D$.

#### Proof of full and faithful.

<details>
    <summary>To Show Full:</summary>
    <p>
        Take arbitrary $\eta :Hom_{\cal C}(C,\cdot) \rightarrow Hom_{\cal C}(D, \cdot)$, we claim that 

        $$Y(\eta_C(id_C)) =^? \eta$$

        To show which, in turn we need take arbitrary $X \in {\cal C}$ and (since $Hom{\cal C}(C,X)$ thank-god is a set) an arbitrary arrow $f\in Hom_{{\cal C}}(C,X)$,  

        $$Y(\eta_C(id_C))_X(f) =^? \eta_X(f)$$

        To show which, by simplification, we need

        $$f \circ (\eta_C(id_C)) =^? \eta_X(f)$$ and we have the following commute diagram since we have $\eta$ as natural transformation:

$\blacksquare$

This is the theorem which is a generalization of cayley theorem.



## ... to Yoneda Lemma

It is not easy to see that the theorem can be generalized further.

> Let $F : {\cal C} \rightarrow \textbf{Set}$ be a set-valued functor,
> 
> Those $Hom_{\cal C}(C, \cdot) \rightarrow F$ 1-to-1 correspond those in $F(C)$.

By take $F = Hom_{\cal C}(D, \cdot)$, we can get the above theorem. But this correpondence is no longer relevent to any functor, i.e. it is not a correspondence between arrows of category, but just a bijection between sets.

## Representable Functor / Universal Elements
A set-valued functor, $F : {\cal C} \rightarrow Set$, is representable if $F$ is naturally isomorphic to $Hom_{\cal C}(C, \cdot)$ for some object $C$ in ${\cal C}$. In that case, we will also say $C$ represents $F$.

Note that, if $F$ contravariant, then the hom functor would be $Hom_{\cal C}(\cdot, C)$. 

What's more, a representable functor is witnessed by a universal element.
