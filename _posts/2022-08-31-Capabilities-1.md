# Menu of concepts
## capability machine


## Graph-based models of capabilities
## secure compilation
> A secure compilation is a compilation that preserves some security property. 

For example, full-abstraction is the notion this thesis focuses on, and achieved by secure compilation. 

### full-abstraction secure compilation

> A fully abstract compiler provably preserves (and reflects) the observational behaviour of a program in any possible context it may be executed in.

From this part, we focus on introducing the low-level security guarantee about memory safety using memory capabilities.

## CHERI processor

CHERI provides the real machine with the concept of local capabilties.  

> To prevent illegal use of stack references, the approach relies on local capabilities, a type of capabilities offered by CHERI to temporarily relinquish authority, namely for the duration of a function invocation whereafter the capability can be revoked.

## capability safety

## well-bracketed control flow
Well-bracket control flow is a very basic in high level language -- it requires function return to the correct point. 

For example, in the thesis, the example is
```C
int a() {
  int x = 0;
  b ();   // Calling point b1
  x = 1;  // Point x2
  b ();   // Calling point b2
  return x; // Point x3
}

void b() // defined unknown
```
In usual case, when b2 is done, the PC will go to point x3. However, a maliciously defined `void b` can try to hack the return point and go to point x2.

Well-bracketed control flow is just saying this kind of hack cannot happen, and it is provably bound to return to point x3, no matter what `void b` is. This security is achieved by capability machine. 

The non-triviality mainly come from the fact that we are working on a low-level machine/language. 
## local-state encapsulation
> We also expect that a functionâ€™s local variables are inaccessible outside the context of the function.

For example, once entering `void b`, `x` is totally unaccessible (not even readable). This challenge also similarly comes from the fact that we are working on a low-level machine, and need to use secure primitive to help us to enforce this.

## local capabilities

***
The collected two paper both achieved "well-bracketed control flow" and "local-state encapsulation" but using different capability mechanism. The first one uses local capabilities (closer to CHERI)
