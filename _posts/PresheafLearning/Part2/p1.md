We cover signature/LCCC a la Sterling in his [thesis](https://www.jonmsterling.com/papers/sterling-2021-thesis.pdf).

# Signature/ Category of Judgement
Thesis 1.1/1.2

* The Category **SIG** can be considered as inductively constructed syntax for dependent type theory
  * It is for specifying LF interface anyway
  * Implementation vs. Signature are like terms vs. types.
    * are like deduction vs. Judgement
    * SO maybe judgement is something like Prop in Coq? but with a lot of constructor inside
  * any judgement 𝕁 is an implementation of signature □  
* a very important note :
  * Table 1.1 : (F : 𝒯 / E) is a judgement-form presupposing E 
    * this is corresponding to 1.4 * 6 -- basically we encode some `E → □` into `F → E` 
#
Thesis 1.4
* For 1.4* 6, the pullback 𝕋, *informally speaking* in other cat logic is usually constructed by
  * for fixed (F : 𝕊 → □) and (π : ∑(𝕁 : □),𝕁 → □) 
  * 𝕋 = `{(s : 𝕊, D : ∑(𝕁 : □),𝕁) : F(s) = π(D) }`
    * ~ `{(s : 𝕊, Sig = F(s), d : Sig)}` ~`{(s : 𝕊 , d : F(s))}`
  * So 𝕋, for a fixed  `(F : 𝕊 → □)`, is basically the dependent pair of the implementation `s` of `𝕊`, and the implementation `d` of `F(s)`
    * basically a sigma type given `F` or something
  * That what he means by, 
    * a judgenent signature 𝕋 are exactly the families that can be encoded by an actual judgment S,
* This is still too abstract, 
  * Say `𝕊 = {tp : □ ; tm : tp → □; 𝔹 : tp}`, say `F : 𝕊 → □ := λ (tp, tm). tm(𝔹)`
    * then one object 𝕋 in `𝒯 / 𝕊`, particularly the 𝕋 of this `F` is 
      * `fst : {(s : 𝕊, Sig = s.tm(s.𝔹), d : s.tm(s.𝔹))} → 𝕊`
    * and then arrows are standard arrows from slice category 
    * because they are all `fst`, so the `s : 𝕊` part is never changed.
* intuitionstically speaking, for signature 𝕊, `𝒯 / 𝕊` are full of objects that are terms of type □ in the context 𝕊  

* **Why 1.4*7 has the right adjoint?**
* 1.4*8, so category of judgement, given a signature 𝕊, seems to be corresponding to the class of `{f: 𝕊 → □}`
  * I have zero intuition about this
  * the objects are other judgements dependent on `s : 𝕊`
  * the arrows are the deduction between these judgements
  * so why... why we need this *relative to 𝕊*?

* 1.4*10 this is the classic categorical semantic stuff. i.e. the theory-model correspondence. The reader can check first several chapters of [this](http://mathieu.anel.free.fr/mat/80514-814/Awodey-Bauer-catlog(2019).pdf) for details.
  * but it is very abstract...
    * we know its objects are judgemental objects (encoding of `𝕊 → □`)
    * morphisms   
  * Let's talk about it a bit later, in model


* TODO: what is the 𝕊 when written a concrete language definition using internal language of Psh?

Thesis 1.5

The key points of this section
1. Certain Representable natural transformation (Thesis 1.5* 3) **weakly classifies all the maps in C** （1.5 *3)
   1. in other words, for every signature 𝕊, and every map `y(𝕊) → 𝒮`, we have a unique corresponding representable `yp : y(𝕋) → y(𝕊)` as the result of the pullback (1.5 *3)
   2. and every representable  `yp : y(𝕋) → y(𝕊)` has a non-unique map `y(𝕊) → 𝒮` as correspondence as well
2. so we basically make sure that, every morphism `y(𝕊) → 𝒮` correspondes to some map in the catregory **SIG**, that makes it possible to discuss any `y(𝕊) → 𝒮` instead -- we can recover the original map using this classifier
3. So Thesis 1.5 is trying to prove `sig : 𝒮' → 𝒮` is representable
4. and most of the result 1.5 *4, *5 (according to) is just a rephrasing Awody's Natural Model paper
5. `𝒮 = ∑(f : SIG^→)(cod(f))`, another type


Some other points
1. Representable object is just embedding of **SIG** into Psh(**SIG**)
2. Meta-signatures are referring to the objects in Psh(**SIG**)
   1. though the meta-signature mentioned in 1.5 * 8 must be those non-representable object 

So it makes the understanding of the Thesis 1.5 into the following questions
1. why doing this correspondence is valid as 
   1. i.e. can we make sure when we are reasoning about the stuff in meta-signature, the reasoning can be faithfully reflected on stuff in **SIG**?
2. What does 𝒮 actually look like and why 1.6 *2 cansay 𝕊(x : 𝕋) : 𝒮
3. In Thesis 1.6, only a little big of meta-signature is used -- only those of type `𝒮` is kind of morphism to `𝒮`, and thus part of meta-signature
   1.  so the intention of Thesis 1.5 seems mainly
       1.  avoid hand-waving when talk about universe `𝒮`, (otherwise □ doesn't have a type)
       2.  Use that classification, we can make a meta-signature `y(𝕊) → 𝒮` into `y(𝕋) → y(𝕊) ∈ (𝒯/𝕋)`, so setup fibrational treatment

# Summary
* For Sterling, the syntax 
  * we first use `Psh(SIG)` (meta-signature) to express the syntax (for example 𝕄𝕃ext)
  * then we apply 1.5, to get the representable `y(𝕊)` (by the idea of 1.7 * 3), where `𝕊 : SIG` is really like a sigma type (for expressing modules)
    * we are not sure what 𝕊 really looks like
  * then we have the category of judgement `𝒯 / 𝕊` that has good universal property according to *Sec 4.3*
* then how do we do model/algebra for it? There are three notions of syntax, are they equivalent?
  * in fact we only work with the second notion, as Sec 4.3 is using signature's syntax for describing the model
    * no meta-signature every appears to me
    * seemingly no fibration happens as well 
* It is highly possible that, meta-signature, can be hand-waved.
  * Section 4.3, the real reasoning, not mentioning `𝔖ig` at all
  * Sheaf semantics of termination-insensitive noninterference, not mentioning meta-signature at all
  * Naïve logical relations in synthetic Tait computability, not mentioning meta-signature at all
* So maybe it is the best to just look at

### Note : Model/Algebra for signature
There are 4 concepts to interpret a signature
* (1.4 * 10) 𝕊 's direct inteprretation/model in ℰ (in the sense of usual logic)
* (1.4 * 10) LCCC functor 𝒯/𝕊 → ℰ (of course the difference between this one and the above is that 𝕊 is not even a category)
* (3.7 * 2) ⟦_⟧𝒰 : **SIG** → ℰ 
* (†)the direct interpretation/model of signature (in the sense of usual logic)
  * this appears in all the important places, like Sec 4.3/4.4.
  * This is the most important part, because 4.3/4.4 is using it

The intuitive reason we can use (†) is because **SIG** (Sec 1.3) is inductively constructed, and can be eliminated (enjoy free property). Since `𝒯 / 𝕊` is just a certain slice on **SIG**, so it (category of judgement *of the syntax*) can be eliminated as well. Basically this makes **SIG** and  `𝒯 / 𝕊` inductive constructed syntax in the usual sense.

But to use this elimination, we should just look at (1.4 * 10), and use that as elimination principel/ free property; and immitate Sec 4.3/4.4 on how to interpret 𝕊 in arbitrary ℰ.
