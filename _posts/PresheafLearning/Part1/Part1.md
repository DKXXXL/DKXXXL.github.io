Lenister, Exercise 4.1.27
* Let `𝔸` be a locally small category, and let `A, A' ∈ 𝔸` with `H_A ≅ H_A'`, then `A ≅ A'`.

This is proved by H_A is full and faithful.

(Full)
For arbitrary η : 𝔸[-, A] → 𝔸[-, B],
η =?=  (- ∘ ηA(id)), true by naturality of η

(Faithful)
the above function is the inverse of H_(-)

# 
Lenister, Example, 4.1.19
* There is a functor 𝕆 : Top^op → Set defined on objects B by taking O(B) to be the set of open subsets of B. 

  * If S denotes the two-point topological space in which exactly one of the two singleton subsets is open, then continuous maps from a space B into S correspond
naturally to open subsets of B (Exercise 4.1.30). Hence 𝕆 ≅ H_S , and 𝕆 is representable.
