Our exploration will focus on the categorical semantic of type theory
<!-- 
the story this time is mainly about
  limit/colimit, adjoint, continuous/cocontinuous
  substitution functor
 -->


<!-- Show 
      in CCC how product is left adjoint to exponential
    Show why substitution can preserve in product, i.e.
    (a, b)[τ] ≡ (a[τ], b[τ])
    in categorical sense/meaning
 -->


<!--
  A lot of categorical structure is limit and colimit
  for example product and coproduct

  Recall (co)continuous preserves (co)limit
  and show how this kind of functor can preserve product and coproduct
  i.e. 
  makes the connection between (a, b)[τ] ≡ (a[τ], b[τ]) and this continuity
    of substitution functor concrete

  Note  Right Adjoint preserves limit
  left adjoint preserves colimit
  show substitution functor has both left and right adjoint
    as dependent function and depednent pair
  
  The categorical meaning of 
  (A × B)[τ] ≡ A[τ] × B[τ]

  (∏ A B)[τ] ≡ ∏ A[τ] B[τ↑]

  Because depednet function has this τ↑, substutition functor is 
  not really "preserving" the structure, can we still make depednent product
    a limit in certain category and then substitution is still functor
      and thus preserve that limit?
  
  (∏ A B)[τ] ≡ ∏ A[τ] B[τ↑] this stuff seem beck-chevalley condition

 <!-- 
  Show how depednent product is constructed in CwF using internal language
  basically review

    (Category of Containers)
  
  Show how Fibration is coming to the picture
  the equivalence between fibration, indexed category, and Cwf(?)
