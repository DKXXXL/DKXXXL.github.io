# Prop 3.1.8
(1) ⇒ (3) by definition of strict pullback
We have another strict pullback referred to in (Ref 2), which is a fiber product, 
explicitly a category with objects `(u → p(a) ∈ 𝒞^→)`
And that pullback is isomorphic to `A^→` according to (1) (and uniqueness of the pullback). 

(1) ⇐ (3) is similar.


Recall : Strict pullback doesn't respect equivalence of categories (Ref 3) but respect isomorphism of categories. 

I cannot understand the proof indicated in (1) ⇔ (2) 

# Prop 3.1.9
Just draw the diagram, we can see that it is an isomorphism between an arrow and a triangle.
