# Recall 
* Fam(ℂ) is 
  * objects are (I : Set, X : I → ℂ₀) 
    * I is also named as index
  * arrows are `(u : I → J, f_i : X i → Y (u i))`
    * arrow composition `(u : I → J, f_i : X i → Y (u i))` and `(v : J → K, g_j : Y j → Z (v j))` gives
      * `(v ∘ u : I → K, (g_{(u i)}) ∘ f_i : X i → Z (v (u i)))`
* p : Fam(ℂ) → Set, by mapping objects to the index, is a fibration
For arbitrary `(J : Set, Y : J → ℂ₀)` with `u : I → J`, we choose the lifting as 
`(u, id) :  (I : Set, Y ∘ u : I → C₀) → (J : Set, Y : J → ℂ₀)`
then for arbitrary
