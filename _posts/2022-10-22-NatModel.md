This post is to review 
1. First Steps in Synthetic Tait Computability: The Objective Metatheory of Cubical Type Theory
2. Naive Synthetic Tait Computability
3. [Natural models of homotopy type theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3219)

Ref 3 most. Mainly because, we don't actually know `∑ tp : 𝕌, tp → 𝕌` meaning in (Ref 1) Sec 3.7*3, which seems a standard notation in natural model but you can see this notation already pretty HOAS!

Generally speaking the HOAS stuff is always what we are concerned about.

***

Definition of Representable Natural Transformation, Universe, and etc is covered in
