Topos has a rich internal language, which can be used to express logic. This time, we are getting familiar with this language, and concretely talk about this language in presheaf topos.

In the meantime, Yoneda might appear everywhere when relating the presheaf topos and the original category.

## Yoneda Lemma


Intuitively speaking, Yoneda can embed the original category (fully + faithfully) into the structure of topos.  

***

Last time, we already know Î© is just like the `Prop` in a topos, that it stands for truth. This time, the internal logic will be heavily

I think working with elementary topos here is fine. So we stick with elementary topos.
