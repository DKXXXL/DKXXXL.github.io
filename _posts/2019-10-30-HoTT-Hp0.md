Note that, we will start off with introduction of homotopy theory. Since I haven't been exposed to topology, that would be very interesting.

The current target is to understand P78,79 of the HoTT Book completely.

***
Given a topology $X$

Recall
> A path between $a, b \in X$ is a **continuous** function $f: [0,1] \rightarrow X$

Continuous is something only topology can define.

A path has inverse $p^{-1}$, and two path $p \centerdot q$ can concatenate to another path.

> Proof: A concatenation of two path (continuous) functions lead to another path (continuous function).

Now we can define homotopy.

> Given $X_ 1, X_ 2$, a homotopy between two paths $p, q: X_ 1 \rightarrow X_ 2$ 
> is a continuous function $H : X_ 1 \times [0,1] \rightarrow X_2$ s.t.
>  
> $H(x,0) = p(x); \  H(x,1) = q(x) \ \  \forall x$

In this context, we can say $H$ is a *2-dimensional path between paths*.

Interestingly, since product is the left adjoint of the exponential, it is basically mapping $[0,1]$ to the functional space. But if defined in that way, the definition of *continuous* is not trivial (for me). 

> Proof: Homotopy is an equivalent relationship.


> Proof: Concatenation and inverses respects homotopy equivalence.


> Example: $p \centerdot p^{-1}$ can be shrinked into the identity path (i.e. $ \_ \mapsto p(0)$) 


More definition,

> When $H : [0,1] \times [0,1] \rightarrow X$ is a homotopy,
> 
> if $H(0,t) = x$ and $H(1,t) = y$ for all $t$ (i.e. for each fixed $t$ $H(\cdot, t) $ is again a path from $x$ to $y$)
> 
> then $H$ is said to be endpoint preserving (rel ending).
