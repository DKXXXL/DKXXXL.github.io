Checked C is based on LLVM/Clang.

Note that, for clang, the entry point is located at
`llvm-project/clang/tools/driver/` [Link](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/d03d98b71d03eaf2a84e62e461b4fc87940866f1/clang/tools/driver/cc1_main.cpp#L185)

Most Clang functionalities are wrapped inside [tools/libs](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/clang/lib) to achieve reuses.

For checked C, the main documentation is located in [checkedc-clang/clang/docs/checkedc](https://github.com/microsoft/checkedc-clang/tree/master/clang/docs/checkedc)
