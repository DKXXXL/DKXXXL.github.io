This note is about the categorical semantic of dependent type, 
but doing things from concrete to abstract, and each consecutive part will be connected--
1. we start with the most accessible Substitution Calculus following (Altenkirch, Kaposi)
   1. we will take a lot of time on this part, mainly getting familiar with de Bruijn indices and so on
   2. also we need to list
   3. also inspect that STLC will be a trivial degeneration case for dependent type, so we will basically ignore this
2. Then we dive into [Category with Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00827), 
   1. [and all the variants](https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/questions/1086/what-are-the-motivations-for-different-variants-of-categorical-models-of-depende)
3. Finally we get into [indexed category and fibrational](https://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/ma139/docs/thesis.pdf) and their application on categorical semantic
   1. we need to see what is the main motivation for us to use this new language

But to be honest, I don't think these can connect to category of judgement and thus topos theoretic stuff a la Sterling... Maybe this sequence of knowledge is already outdate---though I think fibration won't be out dated
