# Notes on Category Theory, __1__.

## First Example: UMP

I will first say things abstractly because it makes things __simple__ but not necessary easy. We will need to understand the formal definition, which is the hardest thing to do:

> *Universal Mapping Property of M(A)*
> 
> There is a function $i:A \rightarrow  \vert M(A) \vert$, and given any monoid $N$ and any function $f: A \rightarrow  \vert  N  \vert$, there is a __unique__ $f'$, s.t., $\vert f' \vert  \circ i = f$ 

How to understand this? This long, abstract definition? This is actually a pretty standard math language but those 3 arrows make people confused, especially in the case that you don't have intuition about them because there is no meaning. 

From Curry-Howard-Corrsepondence, we know every proposition is actually some kind of function, by giving "a proof/an input" (phrase as 'for arbitrary'), a proposition will "spit out a proof/an output"(phrased as 'there exists'). We can use this similar "input/output" idea on the commutative diagram --

> Three nodes stand for $A,  \vert M(A) \vert ,  \vert N \vert$ respectively. Draw two normal arrows $i: A \rightarrow  \vert M(A) \vert$ and $f: A \rightarrow  \vert N \vert$, indicating the input(condition) of the proposition, then draw a __dotted__ arrow $\vert f' \vert :  \vert M(A) \vert  \rightarrow  \vert N \vert$ indicating the output(result) of the proposition.

With simply two ways of drawing arrows, we can easily write down the above proposition. This way of computation is easy and possible to memorize. 

One thing to mention, the above diagram stands for (part of) a category of __Set__. Because every arrow is labeled with a function (see that $\vert f' \vert$).

Let's try to 'compute' the __uniqueness of UMP__.

### Proof: Given set $A$, the UMP for $A$ is unique (up to isomorphic).

WLOG, we have to show, if $M, N$ are both UMP for $A$ (with $i_M : A \rightarrow M, i_N : $)
